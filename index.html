I have some bad news, we had a database crash and lost the table containing all the text on the wiki. We made daily backups of our database but apparently the database got corrupted over a month ago, so the backups dont work :(.

 The earliest backups that did work is the 04/05(may)/2010 backup. Luckily google was so great to index our wiki a lot so this is saved, you can find our content by typing in google: site:x3wiki.com . Then click the cache link to open the old page.<br><br> If you have happened to have backups could you please contact me at info@mmoserverstatus.com
