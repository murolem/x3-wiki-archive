Traders usually move downwards from Homily of Perpetuity, trading energy from the Solar Power Plants to the 3 stations in the sector. Traders then move freely between these two pirate sectors, trading in various resources that will eventually result in the manufacture of [[Spaceweed]]. ==Description== Currently contested by both Pirate and Teladi forces, this sector is profitable and deadly in equal measure. Diplomacy is carried out with shields raised and targets locked. Your presence may be considered a threat to either side. ==Default [[Stations]]== #[[Computer Plant]] alpha #[[Dream Farm M]] alpha #[[Flower Farm M]] alpha ==[[Asteroids]]== 0 Known {{Pirates Navbox}}
