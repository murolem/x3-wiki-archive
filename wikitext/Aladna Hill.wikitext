==Description==
One of the first systems to be colonised by the Argon after the last Xenon war. Aladna Hill was a supply and support base for the exploration of further systems. The jumpgate used by the Xenon to retreat was left intact, allowing rapid exploration of the space beyond this system and the ruthless hunting of Xenon stragglers by rogue squads of revenge seeking veterans.
