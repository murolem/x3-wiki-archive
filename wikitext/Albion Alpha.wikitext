Following the deployment of several Jonferco-built Trans-Orbital Accelerators, the sector was rechristened Albion Alpha, and for undisclosed reasons the gate was towed to the region now known as Albion Gamma. the sector now houses a mixture of high-tech facilities and mies. A further facility also resides within this sector; however little information is available due to hightly restricted access. This has fueled numerous rumours about this station's purpose, the most widespread being that potentially-illegal AI research is conducted there with the knowledge and consent of the Argon government. ==Default [[Stations]]== #[[Beryll Research Station]] #[[Jonferco]] [[Drone Production Facility]] ==[[Asteroids]]== 14 Known ==[[Missions]]== [[X3ap:7_The_Beryll | Albion Prelude: The Beryll]] {{Argon Navbox}}
