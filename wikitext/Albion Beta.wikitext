==Overview==


==Description==
This region was chosen by JSDD as the second sector within the Albion system for settlement. This is most likely due to the slightly higher solar intensity which has led to this area providing most of the energy for Jonferco's operation in the system, fuelling their rapid expansion. In addition to the power production facilities, this sector also houses a similar mixture of high and low tech facilites in Albion Alpha, which allows the sector to be largely self-reliant.
