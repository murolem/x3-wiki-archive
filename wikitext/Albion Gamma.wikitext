==Overview==


==Description==
Located in a vast, dense ring of debris, the Albion system quickly attracted significant interest from several mining corporations and Jonferson Space Dynamics Division. After heavy mining depleted the most easily accessible resources, Jonferco began to change the face of Albion with their Highway project. Highways promise to create a network of fast travel lanes throughout the entire system. Still under construction, until these devices are opterational the gapes between developed regions are linked by Trans-Orbital Accelerators. As the gateway to the Albion system, this sector is heavily patrolled by Jonferco, Plutarch and Argon vessels.
