After heavy mining depleted the most easily accessible resources, Jonferco began to change the face of Albion with their Highway project. Highways promise to create a network of fast travel lanes throughout the entire system. Still under construction, until these devices are opterational the gapes between developed regions are linked by Trans-Orbital Accelerators. As the gateway to the Albion system, this sector is heavily patrolled by Jonferco, Plutarch and Argon vessels. ==Default [[Stations]]== #[[Jonferco]] [[Military Outpost|Defence Outpost]] #[[Jonferco]] [[Trading Station]] #[[High Yield Production Complex]] beta #[[Marine Training Barracks M]] beta ==[[Asteroids]]== 14 Known ==[[Missions]]== [[X3ap:2_Jonferco_Eavesdrop | Albion Prelude: Jonferco_Eavesdrop]] {{Argon Navbox}}
