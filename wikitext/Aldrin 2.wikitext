==Description==
This sector was once a quiet area, in which the only feature was the deactivated jumpgate drifting lifelessly in orbit around the planet Armstrong. With the growing Terran interest in the jumpgate, this area of space quickly transformed into a thriving hub where technology and knowledge are traded between the two peoples.
