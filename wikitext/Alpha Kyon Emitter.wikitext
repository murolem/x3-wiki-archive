It generates and emits Kyon particles that line up in a straight line. How these particles are generated is not currently known. This is most commonly found in Kha'ak ships. ==Commentary== Standard Light weaponry used by the Kha'ak. All scouts, interceptors and fighters are generally equipped with these weapons. Sadly, the only way to get your hands on one is by capping said ships, and due to the nature of the Kha'ak they bail their fighters very rarely; even more rarely is having the weapon intact after the pilot bails. As a Kyon Emitter, it has extraordinary projectile speed and thus great accuracy, making it ideal for swatting down fast-moving targets and getting first hits. ==Known Compatible Ships== All Kha'ak ships can equip this weapon, and oddly the [[Terraformer]] CPU ship "[[Deca]]" as well. ==Available at Known Docks== Not available for sale at any dock.
