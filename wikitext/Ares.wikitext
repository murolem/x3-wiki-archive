Boasting a large array of launchers, the Ares packs a powerful punch. ==Physical Characteristics== While of obvious [[Paranid]] design and coloration, the Ares is longer, more cylindrical, and sleeker than its [[M7]] counterparts, the [[Deimos]] and [[Agamemnon]]. == Combat == The Ares is pretty much unbeatable in a fight; like all M7Ms, it can take out any enemy that threatens it before they get close enough to get a target lock, let alone a shot off. With moderate Capital-grade shielding, the few ships that might get close to an Ares will have a hard time pressing home the advantage before they find themselves sucking vacuum. == Equipment == '''Missiles:''' *[[Hammer Heavy Torpedo]] *[[Flail Barrage Missile]] *[[Boarding pods]] == Availability == *[[Third Redemption]] *[[Heaven's Assertion]] == Suggested Roles== The Ares is a capable missile platform and effective boarding ship due to its above average survivability and lack of weaknesses. == See Also== *[[Agamemnon|Paranid Agamemnon]] *[[Ariadne|Paranid Ariadne]] *[[Deimos|Paranid Deimos]] {{M7M}} {{Paranid Navbox}}
