==Description==
Fully militarised, all traffic within this sector is marked for intense scrutiny. Nominal access to Shipyard and Equipment dock facilities are authorised once security clearance has been confirmed. Any interference with military affairs will be dealt with by lethal and overwhelming force.


==Shipyard Availability==
This shipyard serves the heavily militarized Argon Sector M148's anti-Kha'ak activity.
