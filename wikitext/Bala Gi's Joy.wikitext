==Description==
===Encyclopedia Entry===
Deep in unclaimed space, this system is little more than a long-established and well-respected ambush. Rogue [[Teladi]] and [[Argon]] stations provide cover for aggressive [[Pirate]] strike forces. A single, cratered moon holds the wrecks of many of the ships disabled, stripped and left to fall to its surface by freebooters, hullcutters and privateers.
