==Overview==
A [[Boron]] friend of Mahi Ma and [[Julian Brennan]].
According to encyclopedia entries in-game, Bala Gi is the creator of the [[M3+]] spaceship concept, which are the most expensive though also the most powerful fighters available. Speaking to Bala Gi also starts a quest that ultimately gives the player control of a [[Xenon Hub]], allowing them to rewire limited sections of the X Universe to their liking at a time. However, this is easily the most difficult quest in the game and requires incredibly massive amounts of resources to complete.
