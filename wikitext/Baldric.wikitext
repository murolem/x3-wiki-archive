It has a sloping, wedge-shaped bow and rectangular hull. ===Baldric=== The basic Baldric has eight sublight thrusters, four of which are mounted on short outriggers amidships. ===Baldric Miner=== The Baldric Miner eschews the outrigger-mounted engines and has a slightly flatter hull. == Combat == With its heavier than average shielding, the Baldric will survive longer than any equivalent TS, and it has more bite in its turret to boot. However, arming said turret is a very expensive proposition. == Equipment == The Baldric mounts only the [[EMPC|electro-magnetic plasma cannon]] and [[Poltergeist Missile|Poltergeist missiles]]. The Baldric Miner can additionally carry [[Mobile Drilling System|mobile drilling systems]]. == Availability == The Baldric is available from all Terran shipyards, which are found in [[Mars]], [[The Moon]], [[Saturn]] and [[Terran Unknown Sector 1]]. {| style="text-align:center;" |+'''Availability''' |- style="{{Colour/Terran}}" !

Baldric Miner || || || || x |} == Suggested Roles== A reasonable freighter, the Baldric is always going to be a decent contender for a trader. Its stats are well-balanced, and are slightly higher than the other resident fence-sitter, the [[Mercury(ship)|Mercury]]. Its popularity is crippled by the fact that it has no larger variants, leaving it with a distinctly mediocre 4,500 unit cargobay. Also, due to naturally high shielding, it is good for trading ventures in dangerous space. == See Also== {{TS}} {{Terran Navbox}}
