The Beluga is noteworthy for its cameo appearance in [[X: Beyond the Frontier]] during the game's tutorial. This makes it the oldest canonical Terran missile in terms of age. ===Encyclopedia Entry=== This is the popular Terran missile called the Beluga. It is the standard earth fleet missile used onboard fighter craft. ==Commentary== The Beluga is a [[Terran]] missile, but curiously is only compatible with [[Commonwealth]] ships. It is capable of demolishing all but the heaviest of fighters in one hit, and its high compatibility mean that one can pop out of a launch tube in pretty much any fight. They are rare, however, and cannot be bought or manufactured anywhere. {{Missile Navbox}} [[Category:Not Purchasable]]
