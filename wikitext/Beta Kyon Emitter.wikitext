==Overview==
The Beta Kyon Emitter is the medium power Kha'ak beam weapon, equipped on Corvettes.

==Encyclopedia Entry==
This weapon is of Kha'ak Origin. It generates and emits Kyon particles that line up in a straight line. How these particles are generated is not currently known. This version is more powerful than the Alpha Version, it is most commonly found on Kha'ak ships.

==Commentary==
A dangerous [[M3]] and [[M6]] [[Kha'ak]] beam weapon, this is the mid-range variant. Its power against shields is relatively poor, but its damage to ship hulls is deadly. This weapon works well in tandem with many [[Alpha Kyon Emitter]]s, due to their more normal shield-hull damage ratio. This is the main reason for [[Kha'ak Cluster]]s' dangerous reputation. The new [[Kha'ak Corvette]] has a large array of these due to its newer design, making it uncharacteristically deadly even alone.

==Known Compatible Ships==

* [[Kha'ak Corvette]]
* [[Kha'ak Fighter]]
