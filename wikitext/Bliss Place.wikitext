NPC stations will also trade for [[Stott Spices]] as secondary resources. ===Encyclopedia Entry=== A Bliss Place is a factory in a secret location hidden deep within Teladi sectors where the Teladi produce the narcotic drug known as Space weed from the stems and leaves of the Teladian Swamp Plant. Despite being made illegal throughout the universe Space weed is a popular recreational drug used by members of many races and is in great demand. Usually, due to severe restrictions concerning its transportation, it is only traded by Space Pirates. In an attempt to make the narcotic more acceptable to various interplanetary authorities the Teladi add a number of Boron Spices to the drug to reduce its so called dependency. ==Availability== This factory is unique to the Teladi. {| |- valign="top" | style="padding-right:5em;" | ===L-type=== {| style="text-align:left;" |- valign="top" *{{sa|Ceo's Sprite}} *{{sa|Grand Exchange}} *{{sa|Ianamus Zura}} |} | ===M-type=== {| style="text-align:left;" |- valign="top" *{{sa|Ceo's Sprite}} *{{sa|Ministry of Finance}} *{{sa|PTNI Headquarters}} *{{sa|Seizewell}} |} |} {{Stationcategory}}
