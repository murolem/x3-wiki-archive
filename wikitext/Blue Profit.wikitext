==Description==
A busy and lucrative system with an economy dependent on high-quality electronics. Blue Profit is most famous as the source of the distinctive style of music devised by Teladi factory workers. Combining Teladi reed-whistles and Boron toneshells with Argon and Teladi percussion instruments, 'Teladi Blues' is appreciated by many sentient species.
