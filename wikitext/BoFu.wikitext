BoFu meals are known to be very nutritious and healthy. The Boron love them and it is said that their pilots can live on just a nugget of BoFu for almost a week. BoFu is grown in special BoFu Chemical Labs from Plankton and other secret ingredients. Even though the Boron are famous among other races for their delicious Stott spices, the taste of BoFu is no joy to anybody but them.
