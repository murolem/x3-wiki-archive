==Overview==
===Encyclopedia Entry===
BoGas. The unusual natural resources found within the planet Boron mean that the planet is really a huge chemical factory. From these many chemicals the Boron manufacture a unique gas that is used throughout the universe as a painkiller and anaesthetic. After the Boron government stopped the use of the natural resources of its planet Boron gas is now artificially reproduced in [[Bio Gas Factory|Bio Gas Factories]] throughout the Boron Kingdom.
