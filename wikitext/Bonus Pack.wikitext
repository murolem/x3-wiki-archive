A "Bonus Pack" has been released for each version of x3 - [[Reunion]], [[Terran Conflict]] and [[Albion Prelude]].

It contains a selection of user-submitted [[Scripts & Mods|Scripts]] that [[egosoft]] found both useful, and well made enough to officially endorse and redistribute.


They are available for download from the [{{linky}}egosoft.com Egosoft Website].


==Installation==
''(As of 17<sup>th</sup> July, 2013)''

The Bonus Packs are released primarily as .exe files, and so while the scripts are 100% compatible with the Linux Distributions of the game, the .exe file will not run as it does not detect the game installation.

There are two known ways to get the Bonus Pack installed under Linux - one is to copy the files from a Windows installation of the game, after extracting them. The other is to use a programme like [{{linky}}https://github.com/dscharrer/InnoExtract InnoExtract].

As with all [[Scripts]] for x3, it becomes a case of simply putting them in the correct folders within your x3 Installation - e.g. in Linux the default location would be:

"''~/.steam/steam/SteamApps/common/x3 Terran Conflict/addon/scripts/''" and "''.../addon/t''"
