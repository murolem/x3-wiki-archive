==Overview==
===Encyclopedia Entry===
A C-Ration or Combat Ration, consists of a small array of dry but highly nutritious food blocks. The 'rat-packs', as USC marines like to call them, can be prepared for eating using water and a special plasma heater carried by soldiers.
==Commentary==
C-Rations are in high demand at many Terran station types.
