'Capping', short for capturing, is a term used to describe pirating of NPC ships. Pilots of [[:Category:Fighters|fighters]] and freighters will sometimes [[bail]] out when fired on, then the ship may be [[claim]]ed; [[Capital Ships]], [[M6|corvettes]] and [[TM]]-class vessels must be [[boarding|boarded]] with [[Marines]] to be captured. Aggressive pilots will often fund their ambitions with profits from selling capped ships.
