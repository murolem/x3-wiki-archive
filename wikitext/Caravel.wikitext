==Overview==
Weak, and with generally sub-standard common stats, the '''Caravel''' is a second-rate [[TM]].

==Background==
With its ability to quickly deploy and recover fighters, the advent of the Caravel has added to the aggression and organization of [[pirate]] raiding activity.

==Physical Characteristics==
The Caravel is a cross between a [[Pelican|Teladi Pelican]] and [[Magnetar|Argon Magnetar]], with the Pelican's outriggers mounted to the Magnetar's helmet-shaped bow.

== Combat ==
Although the Caravel has a wide choice of weapons to choose from, its poor defenses, mediocre speed and low shield recharge rate make it very vulnerable in combat.

== Equipment ==

== Availability ==
The Pirate Caravel is not sold and must be [[boarding|boarded]] to be added to the player's collection.

== Suggested Roles==
The Caravel is more of a showpiece than anything else; there's no task for which another TM fails to be both superior and easier to acquire.
