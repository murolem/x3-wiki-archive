This setor is now home to the Cardinal who chose this sector for the capital of the Second Dutchy. The system boasts shipyard facilities, and equipment dock, as well as being guarded by a [[M2|Destroyer]] ship, mainly for protection from the Pirates from past the north gate. ==Shipyard Availability== {{Shipyard/Begin|Station|ST Size|Cost}} {{Shipyard/Station|Weapon Component Factory||12000|623,268}} {{Shipyard/Station|Chip Plant||16000|6,778,056}} {{Shipyard/Station|Wasp Missile Factory||11500|1,447,804}} {{Shipyard/Station|Lasertower Factory||18500|1,220,568}} {{Shipyard/Station|Particle Accelerator Cannon Forge||16000|4,112,732}} {{Shipyard/Station|Shield Prod.
