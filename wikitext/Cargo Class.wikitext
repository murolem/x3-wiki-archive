Each ware has a transport class (or cargo class) and takes up a specific amount of ship cargo-hold, for example one unit of Rastar Oil takes up 6 units of space in M class containers, a unit of Argnu Beef takes up 4 units in S class containers, and an Ore Mine takes 8000 units in ST class containers. Note that this also applies to weapons and shields (even when installed).<br>
All together these wares would take up 8010 units of space on a TL class transport. TL to handle the ST cargo 8010 for the combined space.


Some types of equipment (e.g. jumpdrives) also have a minimum cargo class, and can only be installed on ships capable of transporting that class (although they don't actually take up any space).
