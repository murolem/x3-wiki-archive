In the in-game Property menu, the option to hide "fighter" class ships also includes M8 bombers - which I didn't realise at first & was kind of confusing (I though my bomber wing had got wiped out!) I don't know if that counts for anything, but it's a clue that the game itself considers that class of ship to be merely large fighters, although they cannot dock in carriers (which, considering the firepower of M8s, would probably be way overpowered in any case).

Interesting.<br>
M8 Bombers, TM Military Transports and M6 Corvettes are oddballs in the X Universe so we're loosely ginning up a new category for them of [[:Category:Escort|Escorts]]. It may however be worth mentioning in the article the game behavior. [[User:Madned|Madned]] 23:19, 29 April 2011 (CDT)
