These ships must be [[Bigship Boarding|boarded]] by [[marines]] in order to be captured. The sole exception are abandoned ships which may be claimed normally by the player. As a rule of thumb, if a ship can carry marines then it must be boarded to be captured. An exception to this are {{TPclass}} ships. Another exception are the special cases like the Kha'ak ships which do not appear to be capturable in general. However, if a Kha'ak capital ship ''could'' be captured it would have to be boarded. {{Piracy}} {{Shipcategory}}
