Boarding ships are vessels capable of taking on marines and then launching them to [[Boarding|board]] other vessels.

{{M7Mclass}} ships are the only vessels in the [[X-universe]] that may use [[boarding pods]], and some of them are not compatible with the missile.

Other boarding ships may only deploy marines in a 'space walk' maneuver.

Boarding ships may be generally classified as:
*{{TPclass}}
*{{M6class}}
*{{M6+class}}
*{{M7Mclass}}

{{TPclass}}s are unusual as they are boarding ships that can bear marines, but cannot be boarded themselves and are instead vulnerable to [[bail]] and [[claim]] mechanics.
