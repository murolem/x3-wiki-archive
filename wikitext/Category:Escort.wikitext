A category for escort-class ships - [[M6|corvettes]], [[M6+|heavy corvettes]], [[M8|bombers]] and [[TM|military transports]]. Escorts is a term used here to describe several hard to classify ships. Escorts can dock at all stations, but cannot dock with carriers. They typically are not armed with the heaviest weapons like the [[PSP]] or [[PPC]]. They generally feature cargo bays in the 500-1000 range. They work best in a group, escorting larger ships, leading fighters, or operating as a homogeneous flotilla. Individually they are extremely vulnerable, lacking fighters' speed to escape or the firepower and shields of a capital ship.
