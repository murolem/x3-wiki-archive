Stubs are seed articles.

Show one a little care and feed it some information, help it grow into a nice health article.

It might be as simple as finding a data sheet the creator didn't know about or didn't have time to reference when creating their article.

For example:<bR>
[[List of Argon Factories:XTC]] and Argon factory stubs.
