==Overview== One of the five possible sector names a player gets to choose from at the end of the [[A New Home]] [[missions]]. It is located north of the [[Unknown Sector (20,5)]] east of [[Zyarth's Dominion]]. ==Appearance== Upon entering the sector, the player sees an asteroid belt directly in front of them. In the top left of the screen there is 3 planets, a gas giant, what appears to be a desert planet, and it's smaller moon. Behind the gate there is a nebula that lightens up the rest of the place, giving it some sort of feel to it. http://i55.tinypic.com/2q8djir.jpg ==Asteroid/s== This sector contains approx. 27 asteroids for the player's own uses. Out of all of the possible player owned sectors, Cathedral of Xaar has the second least amount ore, and the second least amount of silicon. However, the Unknown Sector south of it contains asteroids of varying yields in case this isn't enough for you. ==Sun/s== As with all other possible sector choices, Cathedral of Xaar contains 300% sun. (2 separate suns)
