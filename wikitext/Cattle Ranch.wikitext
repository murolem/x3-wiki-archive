They require a constant supply of [[Energy Cells]] to function. NPC stations also purchase [[Plankton]] and [[Scruffin Fruits]] as secondary resources. ===Encyclopedia Entry=== Argon cattle ranches are large farms dedicated to the breeding of the creature known as the Argnu, farmed for its processed blocks of meatsteak known as Cahoonas. The space ranches contain vast open plains where herds of Argnu roam freely. The herds are culled by teams of robots and the meat processed in great factories positioned at the far side of the farm. It is then transported to Cahoona Bakeries for transformation into Cahoona Meatsteaks. ==Availability== This factory is unique to the Argon. {| style="text-align:left;" |- valign="top" | style="padding-right:5em;"| ===L-type=== {| | '''[[Argon#Shipyards|Argon]]''' *{{sa|Cloudbase Southeast}} *{{sa|Legend's Home}} *{{sa|Light of Heart}} *{{sa|Omicron Lyrae}} |} | ===M-type=== {| | '''[[Argon#Shipyards|Argon]]''' *{{sa|Argon Prime}} *{{sa|Cloudbase Southeast}} *{{sa|Legend's Home}} |} |} {{Stationcategory}}
