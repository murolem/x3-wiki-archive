Although the Split rarely deign to trade with the Boron, both races trade with the Teladi. Much of this business between the feuding species occurs behind closed doors in this sector - all to the greater profit of the Teladi, of course. ==Default [[Stations]]== *Teladi [[Equipment Dock]] ==[[Asteroids]]== {{Asteroid/Begin}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|28|-7780|-3609|-15182}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|8|-10335|250|-3492}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|8|-15037|-1386|-7680}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|5|-6909|-5380|-7771}} {{Asteroid/End}} == See Also == {{Teladi Navbox}}
