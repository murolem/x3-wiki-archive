==Description==
On the border between Teladi and Boron space, this system acts as a major commercial centre for trade between the Foundation and Profit Guilds, as well as providing large amounts of raw mineral resources. Although the Split rarely deign to trade with the Boron, both races trade with the Teladi. Much of this business between the feuding species occurs behind closed doors in this sector - all to the greater profit of the Teladi, of course.
