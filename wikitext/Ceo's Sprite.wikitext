==Description==
Highly destructive [[Particle Accelerator Cannon|PAC]]/[[Photon Pulse Cannon|PPC]] Weapons are built here under strict Teladi Military guard. Most of the personnel in this system are tied to the military arm of the Profit Guild or the smaller Teladi Company Navy. The market for recreational and luxury goods is high among the personnel on guard detail in a relatively safe system.


==Shipyard Availability==
A super shipyard with capability to craft near all Teladi stations.
