Some [[:Category:Capital Ships|capital ship]] lasers can be charged by holding down the fire button when personally firing them from the cockpit/turret. No AI ships or scripts can do this; the player must fire the weapon manually. Damage / shot is ''always'' increased and the energy consumption rises by the same amount (so that [[weapon energy efficiency|efficiency]] is constant, regardless of charging). Damage / second varies by laser when firing fully charged: (showing shield damage) {| style="text-align:right;" cellpadding="3" |- style="text-align:center;" !Weapon !! Charged DPS !! Change !!
