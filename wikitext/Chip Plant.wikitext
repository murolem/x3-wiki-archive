They are usually to be found near to a computer plant with a steady stream of transport ships travelling between the two locations. The chips are manufactured from silicon wafers that are especially treated with various coatings to create the required conductivity. In some special chips, Majaglit is used to provide a special super conductive coating. Once complete the chips are then sent onto the computer plant for installation into the computers. ==Race-specific attributes== {| style="text-align:right;background-color: WhiteSmoke;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" |+'''Chip Plant''' |-style="background-color:LightGray;text-align:center;" !Race!!Food!!Amount!!Station Cost |- style="{{Colour/Argon}}" | [[Argon]] || [[Meatsteak Cahoonas]] || 240 || {{Priceblock|Trusted Ally|5599036}} |- style="{{Colour/Boron}}" | [[Boron]] || [[Bofu]] || 60 ||{{Priceblock|Queen's Guard|5012124}} |- style="{{Colour/Paranid}}" | [[Paranid]] || [[Soja Husk]] || 48 ||{{Priceblock|Friend of Priest King|6778056}} |- style="{{Colour/Split}}" | [[Split]] || [[Rastar Oil]] || 36 ||{{Priceblock|Distinguished Associate|6487196}} |- style="{{Colour/Teladi}}" | [[Teladi]] || [[Nostrop Oil]] || 240 || {{Priceblock|Majority Shareholder|5599036}} |} ==Availability== {| style="text-align:left;" !
