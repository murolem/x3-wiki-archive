It now exists as a welcome, if rough, trading post on a busy route between many species' systems. Few communities hate the Xenon more than the inhabitants of the system. ==Shipyard Availability== Cho's Defeat shipyard is located on the border with Teladi interests.&lt;br> It is in close proximity to the Split shipyards in [[Family Pride]] and [[Rhonkar's Might]]. {{Shipyard/Begin|Station|ST Size|Cost}} {{Shipyard/Station|Crystal Fab|M|15000|3,285,148}} {{Shipyard/Station|Advanced Satellite Factory||18000|3,389,028}} {{Shipyard/Station|Scruffin Farm|M|10000|320,008}} {{Shipyard/Station|Chelt Space Aquarium|M|12500|236,972}} {{Shipyard/Station|Massom Mill|M|11000|804,992}} {{Shipyard/Station|Rastar Refinery|M|13500|1,116,692}} {{Shipyard/Station|Solar Power Plant|L|15750|12,124,536}} {{Shipyard/Station|Ore Mine|L|12000|818,040}} {{Shipyard/Station|Silicon Mine|L|14250|1,022,552}} {{Shipyard/Station|Complex Construction Kit||4250|259,696}} {{Shipyard/Station|Thunderbolt Missile Factory||16500|3,025,452}} {{Shipyard/Station|Low-yield sidearms Fab||15000|2,246,368}} {{Shipyard/Station|Crystal Fab|L|20500|6,583,284}} {{Shipyard/End}} {{Shipyard/Begin|Ship|Class|Cost}} {{Shipyard/Ship1|Elephant|TL|17,415,102}} {{Shipyard/Ship1|Caiman|TS|603,046}} {{Shipyard/Ship1|Iguana|TP|334,918}} {{Shipyard/Ship1|Boa|TM|450,448}} {{Shipyard/Ship1|Raptor|M1|80,276,604}} {{Shipyard/Ship1|Python|M2|92,622,480}} {{Shipyard/Ship1|Mamba|M3|1,607,266}} {{Shipyard/Ship1|Chimera|M3+|5,413,515}} {{Shipyard/Ship2|Scorpion|Vanguard|M4|396,609}} {{Shipyard/Ship1|Asp|M4+|696,165}} {{Shipyard/Ship2|Jaguar|Raider|M5|88,182}} {{Shipyard/Ship1|Dragon|M6|7,689,771}} {{Shipyard/Ship1|Tiger|M7|36,461,288}} {{Shipyard/End}} ==Default [[Stations]]== *[[Split Shipyard]] *Split Equipment Dock ==[[Asteroids]]== {{Asteroid/Begin}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|21|-7087|7647|5938}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|20|11147|-2585|-5195}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|16|14724|1512|3339}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|11|6330|579|-556}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|8|9843|-1056|3525}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|6|1626|8490|3876}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|4|6007|-5182|-10306}} {{Asteroid/Item|Silicon|70|20206|-10499|11091}} {{Asteroid/Item|Silicon|26|-10611|5428|-2579}} {{Asteroid/Item|Silicon|20|-11128|-364|-12618}} {{Asteroid/Item|Silicon|19|-11684|-5027|3339}} {{Asteroid/Item|Silicon|18|-14700|3882|-10938}} {{Asteroid/Item|Silicon|15|5373|-11342|-5959}} {{Asteroid/Item|Silicon|8|-15466|-7449|-14103}} {{Asteroid/Item|Silicon|7|-5933|-2042|-12897}} {{Asteroid/Item|Silicon|6|-17424|-5219|5102}} {{Asteroid/Item|Silicon|6|-11504|-59|-5949}} {{Asteroid/Item|Silicon|6|-7690|3614|-10391}} {{Asteroid/Item|Silicon|5|-10848|2237|6495}} {{Asteroid/End}} == See Also == {{Split Navbox}}
