Hostile activity is generally minimal as it is well guarded by security patrols. The [[Argon Equipment Dock|Space Equipment Dock]] is a useful source of surplus military equipment as well as second hand kit used by the many Argon Military training outposts in the area. ==Shipyard Availability== Located in an isolated corner of the main Argon cluster, this super shipyard can supply ships and stations for operations in Ore Belt. It is capable of crafting most of Argon stations and ships. {{Shipyard/Begin|Station|ST Size|Cost}} {{Shipyard/Station|Free Argon Trading Station||15000|29,929,912}} {{Shipyard/Station|Equipment Dock||10500|51,160,024}} {{Shipyard/Station|Weapon Component Factory||12000|720,656}} {{Shipyard/Station|Crystal Fab|M|15000|3,129,332}} {{Shipyard/Station|Quantum Tube Fab||13500|4,135,652}} {{Shipyard/Station|Chip Plant||16000|5,599,036}} {{Shipyard/Station|Mosquito Missile Factory||10000|603,792}} {{Shipyard/Station|Wasp Missile Factory||11500|1,525,712}} {{Shipyard/Station|Silkworm Missile Factory||13000|28,776,128}} {{Shipyard/Station|Lasertower Factory||18500|1,220,568}} {{Shipyard/Station|Drone Factory||14500|2,898,204}} {{Shipyard/Station|Advanced Satellite Factory||18000|3,233,208}} {{Shipyard/Station|Particle Accelerator Cannon Forge||16500|416,680}} {{Shipyard/Station|High Energy Plasma Thrower Forge||18000|6,850,768}} {{Shipyard/Station|Photon Pulse Cannon Forge||24000|12,777,020}} {{Shipyard/Station|Ammunition Factory||12000|2,830,680}} {{Shipyard/Station|Cluster Flak Array Forge||21000|12,039,488}} {{Shipyard/Station|Phased Repeater Gun Forge||16500|4,856,308}} {{Shipyard/Station|Shield Prod.
