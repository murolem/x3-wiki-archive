Only compatible with certain Races' ships. (namely the Argon, Boron and Xenon, along with some irregularities) ==Encyclopedia Entry== A deadly weapon found on frigates, destroyers and carriers. Based on the Teladi-developed Flak Artillery Array, the recently developed Argon Cluster Flak Array makes several compromises in exchange for using a deadly cluster munition, which explodes at its maximum range into smaller projectiles, covering a greater area with devastating shrapnel. ==Commentary== A very nice-looking weapon as of patch 2.5, the CFA trades a tiny amount of range and power for an unreliable spread effect when the bullet explodes. As of v2.5, it can also cause damage if the bullet itself impacts, since it was essentially useless before then. Now it is a very pretty alternative to the Flak Artillery Array, serving as a more accurate version for those with slower computers due to its larger, slower shots. Note that if your computer cannot deal with the FAA properly, it may be completely frozen by the larger graphics requirements of expanding flak clusters, Catch 22. ==Known Compatible Ships== *[[Cerberus]] *[[Griffon]] *[[Colossus]] *[[Titan]] *[[Boreas]] *[[Thresher]] *[[Carrack]] *[[Mammoth]] *[[Ryu]] ==Available at Known Docks== Akeela's Beacon (Argon) - Cluster Flak Array Forge Alpha (ATEZ-50)
