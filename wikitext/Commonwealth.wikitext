The term "Commonwealth" is a blanket term describing all five of the 'original' [[X-universe]] races; the [[Argon]], [[Boron]], [[Paranid]], [[Split]] and [[Teladi]].

It is another term for '''Community of Planets'''

Particularly, it is used to describe technology and aspects of the economy that are native to the five Commonwealth members and are distinct from the Terran equivalents.

===Former Wikipedia entry===
The Community of Planets is the collective term for the 5 dominant biological species, the Argon, Boron, Paranid, Split and Teladi. The Xenon are exempt as they do not abide to any government structure.
