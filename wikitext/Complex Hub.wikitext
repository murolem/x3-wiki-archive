==Overview==
The Complex Hub is the docking module for a complex. It is created when the first two factories in a complex are linked with a [[Complex Construction Kit]] and can be placed anywhere within 25km of both factories. It is connected by tubes to every other factory in the complex and with 20 docking ports it handles the [[TS|freighters]] and customers for every station in the complex.

===Placement limitations===
Any two factories within 25km of each other may be joined to form a complex.

Any factory within 25km of the resulting Hub can be joined to that complex.

Two complexes can be joined together, in such a case, the first Hub to be selected will remain and the second will be demolished.
