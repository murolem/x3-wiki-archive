==Description==
The Split have chosen to maintain this sector as little more than a trench upon which to launch further attacks against the [[Boron]] in nearby sectors. Boron incursions are routine, as they struggle to regain control. There is little here that does not involve war or conquest.

==Default [[Stations]]==
*[[Military Outpost]]

==[[Asteroids]]==
No asteroids known in this sector
