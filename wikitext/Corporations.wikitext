==Overview== Corporations are private institutions with their own Headquarters and fleets. Like races they keep track of your [[reputation]] and after performing enough [[missions]] they will grant you ships. However, the [[OTAS Shipyard]] uses your Argon rank to determine what ships you can buy. ==List== {| class="wikitable" |- ! Corporation ! Race !
