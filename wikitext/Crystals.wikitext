{{Infobox open}} {{Infobox ware |ware= Crystals |cargoclass=M |volume=4 |minprice=1432 |aveprice=1684 |maxprice=1936 }} {{Infobox close}} ==Overview== Crystals are important for the production of various weapons. They are produced in [[Crystal Fab]] facilities throughout the universe using silicon wafers. ==Commentary== This is a fairly high demand ware in the X-universe. All [[Solar Power Plant|Solar Power Plants]] use crystals to create energy cells. Almost every trading port will buy them. While NPC solar power plants list crystals as a feed stock, they do not consume them normally, and actually produce power regardless of their crystal levels. ==Trading information== {| !
