It does not suffer the speed penalty that shortfalls others in the [[M3+]] class, making it a very dangerous all-purpose fighter. However, since only [[Terran]] weapons equip on it, it is very difficult to arm short of an [[Cloning|exploit]]. ==Background== Being larger and slightly slower than conventional heavy fighters, the Cutlass can normally be found escorting [[:Category:Capital Ships|capital ships]] and large transport ships. ==Physical Characteristics== Like all Terran fighters, the Cutlass has a streamlined, rocket-shaped fuselage painted white with black trim. It appears to be based largely on the [[Scimitar]] chassis, but is broader and flatter to accommodate a pair of defensive turrets. == Combat == A fully armed Cutlass is a shockingly efficient killer. Nothing short of a corvette, or a fighter with a particularly brutal front weapon loadout such as the [[Spitfyre]] or [[deca.cefa|#deca.cefa]], will trouble it in combat. You can trust an automated Cutlass to come off best in almost any dogfight. It is also one of the very few fighters that can claim to be useful against [[Kha'ak]] beam weapons: its shielding is sufficient to keep it alive while its firepower dismantles enemy craft. On the other hand, the slightly low number of forward-firing EMPCs (with lower shield DPS than even the PAC) capable of being mounted result in the Cutlass dealing damage more over the longer term than as an alpha-strike: therefore it's a good dogfighter, but somewhat less capable at instant raw damage. Also, the fighter needs to be cautious of [[M5|scout craft]] as they can easily fly rings around it and its weapons cannot effectively draw a bead on them unless they come flying towards it in a straight line. == Equipment == The Cutlass mounts only the [[EMPC]] for a primary weapon, four fixed, four in two dual-barrel turrets. As secondary weapons, it can use the [[Poltergeist Missile|Poltergeist]] and [[Spectre Missile|Spectre missiles]]. == Availability == The Cutlass is available at most Terran shipyards. {| style="text-align:center;" |+'''Availability''' |- style="{{Colour/Terran}}" !

Its survivability and attack power mean it can defeat most foes, so if enough EMPCs can be gathered for a Cutlass wing, it makes for one of the top choices for an AI controlled fighter, and among the most expensive. However, it will have trouble engaging against [[M5|scouts]], so having a backup wing made up of your own scouts should counter them. == See Also== *[[Scimitar|Terran Scimitar]] {{M3+}} {{Terran Navbox}}
