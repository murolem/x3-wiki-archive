If you enter this system, there is a great possibility that the local military police force will scan your ship; if you have hostile intentions you will be attacked. It is this tightened security that has led to these rumours. The sector itself is a small trade outpost with little need for high tech goods. ==Default [[Stations]]== ==[[Asteroids]]== {{Asteroid/Begin}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|20|-13320|-15531|3996}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|18|-4173|-8302|2131}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|18|7914|-8880|-8198}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|16|16326|-8884|-1243}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|16|4326|-8888|-4154}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|12|9370|-8902|3890}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|12|7237|-8897|-1198}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|10|-36585|18200|35919}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|10|3781|-8893|1934}} {{Asteroid/Item|Silicon|58|6660|-11721|7104}} {{Asteroid/End}} == See Also == {{Boron Navbox}}
