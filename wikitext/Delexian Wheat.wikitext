Argon settlers have taken this plant wherever they have colonised a planet, and nowadays even grow it on gigantic farms floating in space. It is a yellowish green plant that stands four to five feet tall. The top of the plant produces grain which, when threshed, produces a versatile flour like substance which forms the substance for all Argon foodstuff. ==Commentary== ==Trading information== {| !
