This system is heavily guarded in case of attack by Xenon or other forces hostile to the Boron Navy. The sector is filled with high-tech Boron Stations, including those that specialise in the production of new Boron weapons systems. Entrance to this system is granted if you're carrying cargo to this system, or if you have previous access rights. ==Shipyard Availability== A small shipyard lost at the end of nothing. {{Shipyard/Begin|Station|ST Size|Cost}} {{Shipyard/Station|Computer Plant||14000|1,415,340}} {{Shipyard/Station|Ion Pulse Generator Forge||18000|10,434,568}} {{Shipyard/Station|Shield Prod.
