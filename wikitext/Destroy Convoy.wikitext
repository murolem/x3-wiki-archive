A [[Missions#Other Mission|Mission]] often offered at [[stations]]. ==Objective== Mission offered by various races to kill enemy ships in a convoy, useful if you are trying to improve your rep with the employers' faction. You will lose rep with the race you are attacking but it is nothing you can't fix with another mission for the victim race. ==General Difficulty:== Easy. ==What you will need: == * M3/M4 ship. * Jumpdrive. * Decent rep with the race you are attacking to buffer yourself from some nasty trouble. ==What you will find: == * A couple TS class ships, lightly armed. * Sector Police on your back if you're not careful. ==Commentary and Strategy== Beware of police units and sector patrols. Also make sure you have a good rep with the race you're targeting, as you will take a hit here (albeit a smaller one than the gains you will get with the employer race). Rep loss can be minimized by ramming the convoy instead of firing at them. {{Missions}}
