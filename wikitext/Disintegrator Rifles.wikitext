==Overview==
===Encyclopedia Entry===
Disintegrator rifles are a special type of sidearm, which break the individual molecular bonds of any organic material on which it is used. Disintegrator Rifles are considered highly illegal in the majority of space, but are highly prized amongst weapons dealers and smugglers for the price they fetch on the black market.
