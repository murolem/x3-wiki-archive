After a few short hours, he collapsed and fell into unconsciousness. When he woke up, he claimed he had visions of a great battle in this system between the Paranid and a strange alien race, now known to be the [[Kha'ak]]. The Great Duke decided to consult the monks at the Great Monastery on [[Paranid Prime]] in the valley of the setting star. His visions did not occur again and he was granted permission to set up a new temple in this system where he first had his vision. He died without ever knowing the true nature of his visions, or the horror that would follow. ==Default [[Stations]]== ==[[Asteroids]]== {{Asteroid/Begin}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|22|-5511|7339|-21220}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|20|306|-541|12407}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|20|306|-541|12407}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|13|10228|16386|-22063}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|8|-6921|15383|-13427}} {{Asteroid/Item|Silicon|56|2635|-91548|-13117}} {{Asteroid/Item|Silicon|11|6940|-8901|-9193}} {{Asteroid/End}} == See Also == {{Paranid Navbox}}
