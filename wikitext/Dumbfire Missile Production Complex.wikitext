They will also buy [[Cloth Rimes]] and [[Warheads]] as secondary resources. The exception, however, is the Dragonfly Missile, which is actually programmed to be an image-recognition tracking missile, and the developers made an oversight in including it in this kind of factory when in fact, it should have been more appropriately included in the [[Image Recognition Production Complex]]. ===Encyclopedia Entry=== This production facility manufactures Dumbfire Class missiles ==Race-specific attributes== {| style="text-align:right;background-color: WhiteSmoke;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" |-style="background-color:LightGray;text-align:center;" !Race!!Food |- style="{{Colour/Argon}}" | [[Argon]] || [[Meatsteak Cahoonas]] |- style="{{Colour/Boron}}" | [[Boron]] || [[BoFu]] |- style="{{Colour/Paranid}}" | [[Paranid]] || [[Soja Husk]] |- style="{{Colour/Split}}" | [[Split]] || [[Rastar Oil]] |- style="{{Colour/Teladi}}" | [[Teladi]] || [[Nostrop Oil]] |} ==Availability== Dumbfire Missile Production Complexes are default stations in race sectors.
