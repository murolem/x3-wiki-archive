==Description==
===Encyclopedia Entry===
After the [[Kha'ak]] attack on [[President's End]], a decision was made to improve the security of [[Argon]] home systems. A taskforce was assembled in [[The Wall]] and sent to Elena's Fortune. Orders were given to capture and retake the sector, after a Kha'ak attack decimated the pirate forces who had held control over this system for so long. Argon surveillance expeditions later discovered that the Kha'ak attack destroyed the gate leading to the neighboring system of [[Olmancketslat's Treaty]]

Elena's Fortune's story is quite varied. Until 742 NT/2912 EY, the system was owned by the Xenon, with a single station in the middle of the sector, guarded by a J and a K. After Kyle and the Community's fleet kicked them out, it was occupied by Pirates, until the Kha'ak attacked the sector and killed them all. Currently, the Argons own the sector.
