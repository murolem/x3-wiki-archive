==Description==
Goner prophets and mystics, their mission now complete, travel along a very different path to that of their forefathers. The burning prophecy that Nathan R Gunne's words once held is embodied in this sector, now home to an ever-increasing number of believers, intent on ensuring that the truth of Gunne's Crusade lives on in eternity. To that end, each new station is blessed and considered a distant annexe of the Goner Temple.
