==Description==
===Encyclopedia Entry===
This system contains the main [[Paranid Equipment Dock|Equipment Dock]] used to refit medium [[Paranid]] Fighters. These weapons are of the highest quality and Paranid technology is extremely reliable. This system was hit heavily in the last [[X: Beyond the Frontier|Xenon conflict]] and security is still tight. This system represents the far border of the 'Old Paranid Empire,' the 'New Empire' consisting of territories claimed since the conflict.
===Information===
True to the encyclopedia entry, this sector was the farthest south one could get in [[X: Beyond the Frontier]].
