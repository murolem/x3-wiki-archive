It is a favorite location for players wishing to train [[Traders|Local Traders]] using [[Trade Command Software|Trade Command Software Mk. 3]], as the sector has many factories capable of selling directly to one another. ===Encyclopedia Entry=== Perhaps the stunning gas nebulae that dominate the view in this system and the general atmosphere of peace and tranquility are what inspire the gorgeous jewelery crafted by the [[Paranid]] here. The tiny masterpieces they craft from [[Majaglit]] can take years to complete and are collected avariciously by art enthusiasts from around the systems. ==Default [[Stations]]== *[[Military Outpost]] *[[Paranid Trading Dock]] *[[Solar Power Plant]] M alpha *[[Solar Power Plant]] L beta *[[Soyery]] M alpha *[[Soyery]] M beta *[[Soyery]] L gamma *[[Soyfarm]] M alpha *[[Soyfarm]] L beta *[[Space Jewellery]] M alpha *[[Heavy Weapons Complex]] alpha ==[[Asteroids]]== {{Asteroid/Begin}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|14|4072|595|2790}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|14|-36552|-14904|-2709}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|12|596|2725|5920}} {{Asteroid/End}} == See Also == {{Paranid Navbox}}
