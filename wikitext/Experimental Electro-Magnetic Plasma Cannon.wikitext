The Earth Fleet's powerful and highly advanced Electro-Magnetic Plasma Cannon is the most common weapon found on Terran fighters. It uses powerful EM field generators to propel concentrated plasma bolts at enemies ==Commentary== The EEMPC is a weaker version of its mainstream counterpart, reflecting its age, but it has roughly the same energy efficiency and hence drains energy slower. Note that the projectile's size is quite small and players may find it difficult to hit small targets accurately. ==Known Compatible Ships== *[[deca.cefa|#deca.cefa]] *[[deca.deaf|#deca.deaf]] *[[deca.fade|#deca.fade]] *[[spitfyre|Spitfyre]] *[[springblossom|Springblossom]] ==Available at Known Docks==
