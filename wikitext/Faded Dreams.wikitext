==Description==
The Boron colonised this sector with dreams of such magnificence even the Queen offered her blessings. Flourishing for a great while, such dreams indeed became reality until the [[Split]] discovered and gained control over the connecting sector. Trade turned to war and dreams once cherished were left faded and broken.
