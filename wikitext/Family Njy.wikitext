It produces many Split foodstuffs that are shipped to the two planets in this system and neighbouring systems. The Njy family is particularly brutal, offensive and arrogant, even by Split standards. ==Shipyard Availability== One sector away from Xenon Sector 472, this shipyard is a prime repair and sales facility. {{Shipyard/Begin|Station|ST Size|Cost}} {{Shipyard/Station|Chip Plant||16000|5,599,036}} {{Shipyard/Station|Wasp Missile Factory||11500|1,675,036}} {{Shipyard/Station|High Energy Plasma Thrower Forge||17500|6,987,760}} {{Shipyard/Station|Pulsed Beam Emitter Forge||18000|9,068,568}} {{Shipyard/Station|Shield Prod.
