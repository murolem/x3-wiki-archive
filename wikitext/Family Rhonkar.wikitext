==Description==
This system is the property of the Rhonkar Family, one of the dominant [[Split]] clans. Although this system was not always their property, it was seized during the last civil war with the Patriarch of all Split. Success here is ensured by slave labour, illegal mining methods and ruthless workforce control, but this is not a matter that concerns the average Split.
