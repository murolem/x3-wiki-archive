==Description==
The lesser family of Rhy, in the days before space colonisation, spent most of their time on Split Prime, using their knowledge of espionage and sabotage to plunder other families resources and claim them as salvage. Rhy moved off-world to their own system when they became a more powerful family, after helping the family Rhonkar in their battle against the old Patriarch. This sector contains half of the family's assets in space trading, incliding their own carrier. Rhy no longer focuses solely on espionage and have started to build up their own military. There are also rumers in local bars of a hidden gate in or near this system.
