After a territorial dispute with the Njy family, Ryk lost one of their two outposts. The second colony is this system, which was taken from the ownership of the last Patriarch who fell in a great battle with Family Rhonkar. Unlike some other systems in the local area, this system is relatively uninteresting, but one may find the odd skirmish between the [[Ocean of Fantasy|neighboring Boron colony]] and the Ryk Family. ===Information=== As of Albion Prelude, Family Ryk has completely vanished. The south gate in Ocean of Fantasy is inert, and the fate of the Split inhabitants is unknown. ==Default [[Stations]]== ==[[Asteroids]]== {{Asteroid/Begin}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|26|-6580|-11948|-22510}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|21|18874|-14025|-34978}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|16|2251|2597|-37922}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|11|12731|10762|-24889}} {{Asteroid/End}} == See Also == {{Split Navbox}}
