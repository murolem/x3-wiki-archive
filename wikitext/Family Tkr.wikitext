What stopped this family from losing all of its assets was the then Patriarch of All Split, using T'kr as a sign to all Split that such incidents will not be tolerated. Now the sector is home to all of the family's assets, and it hs been only in recent years the the sector has been visited by other families for trade. The sector also makrs the border for the Teladi 'fortune' system block, sectors that the Teladi use for production, also containing the stations that T'kr use as their main source of trade. The family's only destroyer patrols the system. ==Shipyard Availability== A modest shipyard located on the way to [[family Whi]] and close to Teladi sectors. {{Shipyard/Begin|Station|ST Size|Cost}} {{Shipyard/Station|Crystal Fab|M|15000|3,285,148}} {{Shipyard/Station|SQUASH Mine Factory||15000|2,019,132}} {{Shipyard/Station|Lasertower Factory||18500|1,103,708}} {{Shipyard/Station|Scruffin Farm|M|10000|320,008}} {{Shipyard/Station|Chelt Space Aquarium|L|18750|592,496}} {{Shipyard/Station|Massom Mill|M|11000|804,992}} {{Shipyard/Station|Rastar Refinery|M|13500|1,116,692}} {{Shipyard/Station|Solar Power Plant|M|10500|5,388,695}} {{Shipyard/Station|Ore Mine|M|8000|409,020}} {{Shipyard/Station|Silicon Mine|L|14250|1,022,552}} {{Shipyard/Station|Complex Construction Kit||4250|259,696}} {{Shipyard/End}} {{Shipyard/Begin|Ship|Class|Cost}} {{Shipyard/Ship1|Elephant|TL|17,415,102}} {{Shipyard/Ship2|Caiman|Super Freighter|TS|603,043}} {{Shipyard/Ship1|Iguana|TP|334,918}} {{Shipyard/Ship1|Boa|TM|450,448}} {{Shipyard/Ship1|Raptor|M1|80,276,604}} {{Shipyard/Ship1|Python|M2|92,622,480}} {{Shipyard/Ship2|Mamba|Vanguard|M3|2,007,804}} {{Shipyard/Ship1|Chimera|M3+|5,413,515}} {{Shipyard/Ship2|Scorpion|Sentinel|M4|498,318}} {{Shipyard/Ship1|Asp|M4+|696,165}} {{Shipyard/Ship1|Jaguar|M5|49,991}} {{Shipyard/Ship1|Dragon|M6|7,689,771}} {{Shipyard/Ship1|Tiger|M7|36,461,288}} {{Shipyard/End}} ==Default [[Stations]]== *[[Split Shipyard]] *Split [[Equipment Dock]] ==[[Asteroids]]== {{Asteroid/Begin}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|56|18470|-7104|-20601}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|21|22200|-3729|-18648}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|18|-17760|-2664|-6216}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|16|14385|-5328|-17760}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|11|-22022|-5594|-10656}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|7|15984|-1687|5328}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|2|-94128|-19536|-79032}} {{Asteroid/Item|Silicon|38|-33566|-7459|-8880}} {{Asteroid/Item|Silicon|32|-15806|5328|-22200}} {{Asteroid/Item|Silicon|26|10212|4795|-4262}} {{Asteroid/Item|Silicon|9|18648|2131|10656}} {{Asteroid/End}} == See Also == {{Split Navbox}}
