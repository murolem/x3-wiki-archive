The two Teladi systems between Family Whi and the nearest [[Boron]] system provide a buffer between the two feuding species. It is usual, however, to find Split on guard against the unlikely threat of a Boron sneak attack. ==Default [[Stations]]== *[[Split Equipment Dock]] *[[Split Trading Port]] ==[[Asteroids]]== {{Asteroid/Begin}} {{Asteroid/Item|Silicon|6|-23845|6142|4636}} {{Asteroid/Item|Silicon|3|-24568|-6958|-6162}} {{Asteroid/End}} == See Also == {{Split Navbox}}
