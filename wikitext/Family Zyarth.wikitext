Rumors emerged over time that the Ryk family had discovered a new system which they were soon planning to occupy. However, because of a lack of resources, they kept such knowledge a closely guarded secret - or so they thought. Acting upon data collected from their spies, the Zyarth family moved in quickly and established a colony, much to the Ryk family's anger. ===Information=== This sector has completely vanished as of Albion Prelude; the West Gate from [[Zyarth's Dominion]] is lifeless and Family Zyarth cannot be reached by jumpdrive. The fate of its inhabitants is unknown. ==Default [[Stations]]== ==[[Asteroids]]== == See Also == {{Split Navbox}}
