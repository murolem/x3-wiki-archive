==Overview==
The Fenrir is the [[ATF]] heavy fighter. It is fast, well armed and well-shielded.
==Background==
===Encyclopedia Entry===
Not satisfied with the all-round capabilities of the [[Thor]] heavy fighter, the AGI Task Force came up with the bigger, stronger and more dangerous Fenrir.
==Physical Characteristics==
The Fenrir is reminiscent of the ATF's capital ships, and looks like a longer [[Valkyrie]] It is long and angular, but with rounded edges. It features red glass on the cockpit, with touches of red elsewhere on the ship. The main guns are arranged behind the pilot, to either side and above. The forward turret is below the cockpit, with the rear turret under the engines.
== Combat ==
The Fenrir is fast enough to act as an interceptor, but is also heavily armed and shielded to act as a space superiority fighter. With ten forward mounted [[Electro-Magnetic Plasma Cannon|EMCSs]] and two rear-mounted guns, the ship is deadly and well-protected. The Fenrir's only limitation is its missile compatibility, which only give it the ability to combat [[M6]] craft at the largest.

== Availability ==

The ship is purchasable in Albion Prelude:

== Suggested Roles==
The Fenrir is unequaled as a space superiority fighter, especially when launched en masse from a carrier. It does not make an effective bomber against [[M7]] or larger ships.
