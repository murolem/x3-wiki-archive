While remarkably easy to shoot down, if successful, this weapon can yield great damage to a station, and in volume, even destroy it. Its success against large combat craft can be equally devastating when employed on close range attack runs. ==Commentary== One of the slowest and most powerful single-warhead missiles available, the Firestorm is a very dangerous weapon, both to the target and the launcher. Its large blast radius makes it capable of instantly destroying patrols and furballs, and its massive damage puts a nasty dent in [[:Category:Capital Ships|capital ship]] shields. At [[Shields#1_GJ|1GJ]] of damage, it destroys all but the most heavily shielded [[M6|corvettes]], the lowest class of ship capable of launching it with the notable exception of the [[Medusa Prototype]]. As with the use of all nuclear based warheads - '''extreme caution is strongly adviced'''. Premature detonation can be caused by any sort of impact in space and may lead to immediate user atomization if you have insufficient shielding installed.
