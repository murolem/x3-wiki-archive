Flak weapons are [[capital]] ship weapons designed to suppress nearby fighter activity. They are characterised by having a very high projectile velocity, giving them excellent accuracy against fast fighters, but only mediocre range.

Flying into a flak cloud is extremely damaging and disorienting for fighters, and all fighters should be kept well clear of flak-equipped capital ships.

There are three flak weapons available;
*[[Flak Artillery Array]]
*[[Cluster Flak Array]]
*[[Starburst Shockwave Cannon]]
