==Overview==
The Gannet is by far the slowest [[M7M]], but is also the highest capacity and most heavily shielded [[Commonwealth]] M7M with defences that rival many [[M2|destroyers]]. Its combination of glacial speed and glacial capacity (not to mention defences) force upon it limited choices of role: either a one-off strike ship which jumps in, fires its missiles and quickly leaves before it can be swarmed, or a long term attacker, using its freight space to increase its longevity as much as possible and kill as much as possible while limiting or eliminating its ability to retreat by jumping.

==Background==
The [[Teladi]] Gannet adds a heavy strike capability to the Teladi Company's fleet, with a considerable array of offensive options.

==Physical Characteristics==
== Combat ==
The Gannet cannot run from a fight without a jumpdrive, but it can go longer than other M7Ms and has higher survivability if something does get close. With a single rear turret, it also has some defence against incoming missiles.

== Equipment ==
'''Missiles:'''
*[[Hammer Heavy Torpedo]]
*[[Flail Barrage Missile]]
*[[Boarding pods]]

== Suggested Roles==
An effective ship in a missile barraging role, the Gannet can also be used as a boarding ship, but must conduct its [[boarding]] operations at further range than other missile frigates due to its slow speed and inability to outrun [[M1|carriers]] and even some [[M2|destroyers]].
