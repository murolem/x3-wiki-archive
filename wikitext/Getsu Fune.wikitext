In order to underline their own requirements, each race hurriedly built their own space stations. Despite the hefty protests of the Patriarch of the Split, the female discoverer was appointed during the transition to oversee sector development. Each government sent their own workers and colonists, transporters and combat ships, even mighty destroyers to keep the peace in this virgin system. It was the desire of the discoverer of this system to name it after a ship, flown by another pilot whose origins were once a fabled planet, Earth. The sector is now under [[Terracorp]] administration. ===Information=== This sector is a great place to equip newly purchased ships, as there is an equipment dock of each race here. ==Default [[Stations]]== *[[Argon Equipment Dock]] *[[Boron Equipment Dock]] *[[Split Equipment Dock]] *[[Paranid Equipment Dock]] *[[Teladi Equipment Dock]] *[[Boron Trading Station]] ==[[Asteroids]]== {{Asteroid/Begin}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|93|18593|-1867|10897}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|13|-1687|9068|-11135}} {{Asteroid/Item|Silicon|25|-17233|-7972|-790}} {{Asteroid/End}} == See Also == {{Argoncategory}} {{Argon Navbox}}
