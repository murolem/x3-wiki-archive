It is also fitted with a proximity fuse and is designed to be fired in salvos from specially-equipped ships. ==Commentary== Everything that applies to the [[Flail Barrage Missile|Flail]] also applies to this munition, which is even more potent but slightly slower and with less range. The Ghoul is borderline impossible to acquire however, its factory not being purchasable and the couple of initial factories often evaporating because of GoD (Global Decision Engine) meddling.
