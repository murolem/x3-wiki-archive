==Overview==
The Gladiator is the [[Argon]] [[M8|bomber]] craft. It is one of the few bombers not crippled by a serious weakness that is easy to exploit, and is a popular ship in its class; however, it is pretty roundly beaten by the preferred [[Paranid]] [[Hades]].

==Background==
==Physical Characteristics==
Roughly twice the size of a [[Nova]], with a few more parts assembled in different areas of its frame.
== Combat ==
The Gladiator fights with [[Tomahawk Heavy Missile|Tomahawk]] missiles, and can launch up to 8 of them at once. This is enough to devastate any target, however the slow speed of Tomahawks means that the Gladiator struggles against fighters, particularly of the [[M4]] class. A point defence turret does allow it some protection against aggressors.

== Equipment ==
The Gladiator fires the [[Tomahawk Heavy Missile]].

It may also be [[bail|captured]] from [[Argon]] patrols or [[Pirates|pirate]] forces typically spawned by [[Defend_Station|station defense]] missions.

== Suggested Roles==
As a [[M8|bomber]], the Gladiator serves as a missile launching platform from relatively long range to destroy [[:Category:Capital Ships|capital ships]] and stations.
