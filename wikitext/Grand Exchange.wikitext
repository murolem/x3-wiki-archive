==Description==
The Grand Exchange refers to the large skyscraper on the surface of Goldminer's Dream, the primary planet. The traders' exchange centre was supposed to control Teladi Company trade throughout the known universe. However repeated Kha'ak attacks on Teladi communications satellites halted the necessary communications.
