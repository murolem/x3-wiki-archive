The Sun Oil Refineries in this system and more in the surrounding systems are reliant on imported [[Sunrise Flowers]] - making this an ideal location for a [[Solar Power Plant]] and [[Dream Farm]]. The sector description's mention of debut factory ownership is a nod to [[X: Beyond the Frontier]]. In X:BTF, a [[Solar Power Plant]] was the least expensive factory available to the player, and therefore usually the first a player would buy. Greater Profit was the most popular place to place these Plants, thanks to the sector's [[Crystal Fab]] (and the lack of one in [[Seizewell]]). ==Default [[Stations]]== *[[Teladi Trading Station]] *[[Crystal Fab]] M Alpha ==[[Asteroids]]== == See Also == {{Teladi Navbox}}
