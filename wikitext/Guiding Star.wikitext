==Overview== One of the five possible sector names a player gets to choose from at the end of the [[A New Home]] missions. It is located north of the [[Unknown Sector (20,5)]] east of [[Zyarth's Dominion]]. ==Appearance== Upon entering the sector, the player sees a large planet as it crosses over to/from day to night or night to day, it is unknown. When turning around the player sees a large nebula (very similar to Averice, or Unknown Sector between New Income and Montalaar) and what seems to be a planet and it's moon, directly in front of it. It also has two different colored suns, one yellow and one white. http://i51.tinypic.com/33calgo.jpg ==Asteroid/s== This sector contains approx. 27 asteroids for the player's own uses. Out of all of the possible player owned sectors, Guiding Star has the least ore, but has the most silicon. However, the Unknown Sector south of it contains asteroids of varying yields in case this isn't enough for you. ==Sun/s== As with all other possible sector choices, Guiding Star contains 300% sun. (2 separate suns)
