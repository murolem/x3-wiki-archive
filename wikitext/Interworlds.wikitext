The entire system was only accessible via one lone gate when first discovered. Originally an agricultural colony built by the Argon to supply food supllies to rest of Argon Federation, Interworlds has expanded to include more high tech stations and products. It is also home to the 4th Argon Expeditionary Force, which is still looking for any new gate routes that can be used. ==Default [[Stations]]== *Argon Equipment Dock ==[[Asteroids]]== {{Asteroid/Begin}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|30|-5328|0|12654}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|24|-15984|-1531|18648}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|24|18648|0|-9990}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|20|4789|-320|13017}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|20|4789|-320|13017}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|12|-13986|-6660|18648}} {{Asteroid/Item|Silicon|30|-11322|199|14652}} {{Asteroid/Item|Silicon|21|7992|0|-17982}} {{Asteroid/End}} == See Also == {{Argon Navbox}}
