==Overview==
Ion Disruptor Forges are Boron factories that produce the [[Ion Disruptor]] from [[Energy Cells]], [[BoFu]] and 
[[Ore]]. 

NPC stations will buy [[Crystals]] as a secondary resource.

===Encyclopedia Entry===
This forge manufactures the weapon known as the Ion Disruptor. This new weapon is considered more useful than powerful. 

Manufacturing the weapon is a different matter, it is a complicated process, which involves creating a device able to create a stream of ionised particles. This itself is dangerous.
