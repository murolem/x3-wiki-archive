Developed from reverse-engineered Boron ion weapon technology, the Ion Shard Railgun fires ionised 'shards' of super-heated plasma, which are then accelerated to high speeds using magnets. This combination can wreak havoc on weapon systems. ==Commentary== The ISR is a [[Split]] weapon that drains the laser energy of the target it scores. Despite low physical damage per shot, sustained fire can cause heavy damage on par with the [[Matter/Anti-Matter Launcher]] - however overall effectiveness may be limited by the weapon's relatively high power drain (a limitation not shared by the ammo-based MAML). ==Known Compatible Ships== {| cellpadding="5" |- valign="top" | '''Split''' * [[Elephant]] * [[Raptor]] * [[Python]] * [[Tiger]] * [[Panther]] * [[Cobra]] * [[Heavy Dragon]] | '''Paranid''' * [[Hercules]] * [[Odysseus]] * [[Agamemnon]] * [[Nemesis]] * [[Heavy Nemesis]] * [[Deimos]] * [[Hyperion]] | '''Teladi''' * [[Albatross]] * [[Condor]] * [[Phoenix]] * [[Osprey]] * [[Heavy Osprey]] * [[Shrike]] * [[Gannet]] | '''Goner''' * [[Truelight Seeker]] | '''Xenon''' * [[Xenon J]] * [[Xenon K]] * [[Xenon P]] * [[Xenon PX]] * [[Xenon Q]] | '''Pirate''' * [[Osprey]] * [[Carrack]] '''Yaki''' * [[Akurei]] |} ==Available at Known Docks== Produced by [[Ion Shard Railgun Forge]] spread all over the universe and sold to players by few [[Split Shipyard]]. {| ! style="{{colour/Split}}"|Split |- | *Medium Weapons Complexes *Equipment docks |}
