==Overview==
A powerful and versatile [[Terran|USC]] corvette, the '''Katana''' is highly capable in most combat roles. Capable of using the lethal [[Matter/Anti-Matter Launcher]] and with a good cargobay for ammunition, it packs deadly firepower against large ships, and its multiple turrets provide either extra anti-capital firepower or anti-fighter services using [[Electro-Magnetic Plasma Cannon]]s. It is reasonably fast, slower than the [[Boron]] [[Hydra]] but faster than the [[ATF]] [[Vidar]], at around 130 m/s. Its shielding, as with all [[Terran]] craft, is very high for its class, at 1 [[Shields|GJ]]. Its main weapon array only has six slots, but with multiple turrets with several mounts on each its firepower is not compromised.

==Background==
The Katana represents the ultimate in [[Terran|USC]] combat vessel capability. The Katana-Class corvette is equally at home supporting battlegroups or on long-range patrol.

==Physical Characteristics==
Like most [[Terran]] ships, the Katana is a smooth white color with a sleek hull that slopes gently towards the bridge at the bow. Relatively average-sized for a [[M6|corvette]], it is difficult to hit from the front, rear, and sides, but offers a large target from above and below. The Katana's bridge offers an unobscured view of space.

== Combat ==
The Katana, when equipped with anti-corvette weaponry, can murder a ship equal to or even slightly bigger than itself with a frontal charge. It also has enough punch in the turrets to take out light fighters quite rapidly, and heavy fighters scarcely any slower. While [[Matter/Anti-Matter Launcher]]s only tickle most larger ships' shields, with sufficient ammunition and good evasive skill, a Katana in player hands can leverage its weaponry's lack of energy drain to slowly cripple even enemy [[M7|frigates]] at close range, especially when taking advantage of blind spots.

== Equipment ==
'''Hardpoints:'''
*[[Matter/Anti-Matter Launcher]]
*[[Electro-Magnetic Plasma Cannon]]
*[[Mobile Drilling System]]
*[[Repair Laser]]
*[[Tractor Beam]]

'''Missiles:'''
*[[Poltergeist Missile]]
*[[Spectre Missile]]
*[[Wraith Missile]]

== Availability ==
The Katana is available for purchase at [[Terran Shipyard]]s in the following sectors:

== Suggested Roles==
As an escort, patrol leader or player ship, the Katana will excel in most situations not involving a [[:Category:Capital Ships|capital ship]] larger than a [[Carrack]].
