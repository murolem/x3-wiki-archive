==Overview==
Keris Drone Factories are Terran factories that produce the [[Keris]] from [[Energy Cells]], [[Terran MRE]] and [[Silicon Wafers]]. 

NPC stations will buy [[Water]] as a secondary resource.
===Encyclopedia Entry===
The USC fighter drone was named after a small, curled dagger; very apt, with its ability to confound even the most agile ship.

==Availability==
This factory is sold exclusively at {{sa|Terran Unknown Sector 1}}.
