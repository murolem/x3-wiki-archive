NPC stations will buy [[Cloth Rimes]] and [[Warheads]] as secondary resources. ===Encyclopedia Entry=== This factory produces laser towers, developed to become the ultimate defence for all stations. With a powerful laser that only fits into laser towers these weapons are considered to be substantially advanced in comparison to previous forms of weaponry. Laser towers have started to appear in all corners of known space as all races see just how useful these defences can be against small groups of raiders. The artificial intelligence on board these towers allow for them to identify when the station it is protecting comes under attack, it can then adjust its friend or foe system accordingly. ==Race-specific attributes== {| style="text-align:right;background-color: WhiteSmoke;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" |-style="background-color:LightGrey;text-align:center;" !Race!!Food!!Amount!!Station Cost |- style="{{Colour/Argon}}" | [[Argon]] || [[Meatsteak Cahoonas]] || 1410 || {{Priceblock|Trusted Ally|1220568}} |- style="{{Colour/Paranid}}" | [[Paranid]] || [[Soja Husk]] || 188 ||{{Priceblock|Friend of Priest King|1220568}} |- style="{{Colour/Split}}" | [[Split]] || [[Rastar Oil]] || 141 ||{{Priceblock|Distinguished Associate|1103708}} |} ==Availability== {| style="text-align:left;" |-valign="top" | '''[[Argon#Shipyards|Argon]]''' *{{sa|Cloudbase Southeast}} *{{sa|Legend's Home}} *{{sa|Light of Heart}} | '''[[Paranid#Shipyards|Paranid]]''' *{{sa|Cardinal's Domain}} *{{sa|Heaven's Assertion}} *{{sa|Third Redemption}} | '''[[Split#Shipyards|Split]]''' *{{sa|Family Rhy}} *{{sa|Family Tkr}} *{{sa|Patriarch's Conclusion}} *{{sa|Rhonkar's Might}} *{{sa|Rhonkar's Trial}} *{{sa|Zyarth's Dominion}} *{{sa|Zyarth's Stand}} |} {{Stationcategory}}
