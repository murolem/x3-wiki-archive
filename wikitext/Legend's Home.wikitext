==Description==
Unmarked on all public-access navigational systems, until recently this sector simply did not exist. Rumours were ruthlessly quashed until Legend's Home was ready to be born; and so until then, [[OTAS]] perfected their military and technological might in secret. Their Core sector is now open, heavily defended, and still deeply engaged in Research and Development. Tread lightly.


==Shipyard Availability==
Located in the same sector as the OTAS shipyard, this super shipyard provides standard Argon ships and stations.
