With a mixture of food production and solar power generators, this system has grown in importance. The name Light Water was given to this sector as the only habitable planet has an unusually low gravity for its size, its surface being mostly covered in water. The Boron have recently founded a planet-based colony using materials that were destined for the [[LooManckStrat's Legacy]] system before plans were scrapped. ==Default [[Stations]]== ==[[Asteroids]]== {{Asteroid/Begin}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|9|17493|-12938|6748}} {{Asteroid/Item|Silicon|60|-47241|17760|-50527}} {{Asteroid/Item|Silicon|25|8080|-4848|-11455}} {{Asteroid/End}} == See Also == {{Boron Navbox}}
