==Description==
This system serves as the source of ships and equipment for the Argon settlement areas of space recently claimed after the Xenon conflict. The majority of traffic here is comprised of Argon scout ships and transports headed from newly founded colonies and the fringe systems.

==Shipyard Availability==
Located in near [[Ianamus Zura]] and between Pirate and Boron sectors, this shipyard is a lonely outpost separated from home by hostile pirates.
