M4+ ships are light fighters, slower, with heavier armaments and defences than the regular M4s, but they usually don't fit the interceptor role. One-on-one they are often woefully inadequate for taking on [[M3]] ships in combat, having worse firepower and and much worse durability, while often not being any faster. However, they are much cheaper to procure, costing a good deal less than typical [[M3]]s and a third or a quarter the price of [[M3]]+ ships. This makes them good alternatives to [[M3]]s for fighter fleets at the cost of some potency. They constitute lethal symbiotes for [[M1|carrier]] craft. Note that an M4+ designation does not exist in the game. These ships are referred to as [[M4]] class ships in-game, however they are slower, more potent and better defended than their counterparts so they are given an alternate designation in the community. ==Sortable List== {| class="wikitable prettytable sortable" border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" style="text-align:right;" |+ '''M4+ Heavy Interceptors''' !
