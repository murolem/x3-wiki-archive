M7 Frigates are a new development sitting between M2 Destroyers and M6 Corvettes. They represent significant anti-shipping capability. Like [[M6|Corvettes]], they are also regarded to be capable of taking on any other ship, but their lack of maneuverability and large size makes them difficult to maneuver around a dogfight and a large target for the guns of an [[M2]].

Unlike M2 Destroyers, the forward weapons on many M7 Frigates are manually fired, giving the player control of a large portion of the firepower offered by this class.

Some M7s have hangar bays for a small fighter wing; the Split Panther has many and qualifies as a light carrier.

In Albion Prelude, several new "Drone Carriers" were added to the game, M7-size Carriers capable of projecting small fighter wings. They are listed on this wiki as [[M7C]]s.

The missile frigate class is not included here, although there is no in-game distinction; see [[M7M]].
