==Overview== M7C Light Carriers are a a new class of fast and light escort carriers. The distinction between M7Cs and other [[M7]]s was introduced in Albion Prelude along with four new ships, but several ships in Terran Conflict, like the [[Griffon]] exhibited a similar concept. M7C mount significantly less shielding than [[M1]] Carriers, but they are significantly faster, averaging about 40 m/s faster than their race's counterpart [[M1]], and they are significantly cheaper to buy and equip. In their in-game descriptions, the ships are designed to deploy large amounts of fighter drones, and indeed, scanning their cargo reveals a "Drone Hauler" ware, but this has no in-game function. The [[Griffon|Argon Griffon]] was present in Terran Conflict and is a stronger combat vessel than the new ships, but as it is explicitly described in-game as a light carrier, it does not mount the heavy weaponry of other [[M7]]s; adding to the fact that it is equipped with the Drone Hauler in-game, it will be included here. ==Sortable List== {| class="wikitable prettytable sortable" border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" style="text-align:right;" |+ '''M7C Escort Carriers''' !
