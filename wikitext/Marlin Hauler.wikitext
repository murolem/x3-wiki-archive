It was meant to be the Boron bomber class, but is not available at any shipyard. In an early version of the game, this ship could be captured during station defence missions, but this was patched out. There is a mod which gives this ship the model of the Boron Skate and improves its capabilities. ==Background== ==Physical Characteristics== == Combat == == Equipment == == Availability == == Suggested Roles== == See Also== {{M8category}}
