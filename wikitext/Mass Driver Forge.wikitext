NPC stations will buy [[Teladianium]] as a secondary resource. Argon NPC forges produce the weapon and ammunition while the Split Forges only produce the weapon. Generally the Split provide the weapon and ammunition at their medium weapon complexes. ===Encyclopedia Entry=== Mass Drivers are a new invention by the Argon and Split. It makes use of the magnetic firing system that allows the projectile to be fired out at rapid speed without the need for chemical or laser based firing systems. Projectiles are bought separately and are sold in Ammunition Crates. ==Availability== Mass Drivers are limited to the Argon and Split. Only the Split sell Mass Driver Forges. {| style="text-align:left;" |-valign="top" | '''[[Split#Shipyards|Split]]''' *{{sa|Patriarch's Conclusion}} *{{sa|Rhonkar's Trial}} *{{sa|Zyarth's Dominion}} |} {{Stationcategory}}
