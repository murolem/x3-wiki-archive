They require a constant supply of [[Energy Cells]] to do this. NPC stations also accept as secondary resources [[Nostrop Oil]], [[Soja Husk]] and [[Spaceflies]]. ===Encyclopedia Entry=== Massom Mills are Split controlled food processing factories that convert Scruffin, the basic Split foodstuff, into a yellow powder called Massom that is used by many races to mix with and enhance their own food. The Split are also adding Scruffin to Soja husk which produces a different flavoured Massom powder which is preferred by the Paranid race. Massom Mills are powered by engines driven by the Markus Space fly that require amounts of Nostrop. ==Availability== This factory is unique to the Split. {| style="text-align:left;" |- valign="top" | style="padding-right:5em;"| ===L-type=== {| | '''[[Split#Shipyards|Split]]''' *{{sa|Family Pride}} *{{sa|Family Rhy}} *{{sa|Patriarch's Conclusion}} *{{sa|Rhonkar's Might}} *{{sa|Zyarth's Dominion}} |} | ===M-type=== {| | '''[[Split#Shipyards|Split]]''' *{{sa|Cho's Defeat}} *{{sa|Family Njy}} *{{sa|Family Rhy}} *{{sa|Family Tkr}} *{{sa|Patriarch's Conclusion}} *{{sa|Rhonkar's Might}} *{{sa|Zyarth's Dominion}} |} |} {{Stationcategory}}
