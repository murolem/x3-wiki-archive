==Overview==
Medium Shield Production Complexes are NPC factories that produce medium shields from [[Energy Cells]], [[Ore]] and [[Food]]. 

These stations will also buy [[Quantum Tubes]] as a secondary resource.

===Encyclopedia Entry===
This production complex manufactures medium shields

==Commentary==
The Shield Production Facility 25 MJ can be bought from the Paranid Shipyard in Paranid Prime. (Added 12/15/2013)

These factories are unable to be built by the player and do not seem to be built by the [[GoD Engine]] after the game begins. This means that the number in the game is fairly limited.

As they provide both [[Shields#25 MJ|25 MJ Shields]] and [[Shields#200 MJ|200 MJ Shields]], they are typically very useful to a player before they have set up their own shield manufacturing facilities.
