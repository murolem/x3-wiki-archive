It also has a slight speed and generator advantage over the standard Medusa, but this is very small. ==Background== ==Physical Characteristics== == Combat == == Equipment == *[[Firestorm Torpedo]] *[[Typhoon Missile]] == Availability == This ship is unpurchasable, only available through the Duke's Buccaneers corporation missions or the Unholy Traitor gamestart, neither of which are easy. There is a small chance of finding high-tech traders flying this ship who can be forced to bail, leaving you their ship, but this is very unlikely. if you ever get one bring it to the hq and dissasmbale it and have hevy misle asembaleey to make a small wing of them to serve as bombers with a tm beter splt to have speed an strong wing == Suggested Roles== == See Also==
