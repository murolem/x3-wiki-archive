This sector was originally a boron reserch sector, and with a handful of stations this colony was working one. When the colony plans for [[LooManckStrat's Legacy]] fell though after a pirate attack, this colony had to be abandoned. Some stations were scuttled while others were later reactivated by pirate forces who have now laid claim this system. ==Default [[Stations]]== ==[[Asteroids]]== {{Asteroid/Begin}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|28|-41894|-19800|-19802}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|26|-65928|53973|-67802}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|19|-28439|-49726|19292}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|14|-27148|-5944|-9820}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|14|56029|24025|-9880}} {{Asteroid/Item|Silicon|21|-1994|-37832|-29997}} {{Asteroid/Item|Silicon|11|15696|-26127|26215}} {{Asteroid/Item|Silicon|8|1836|16085|14029}} {{Asteroid/Item|Silicon|7|42331|-54177|-25446}} {{Asteroid/Item|Silicon|5|13256|22455|-19856}} {{Asteroid/End}} == See Also == {{Pirates Navbox}}
