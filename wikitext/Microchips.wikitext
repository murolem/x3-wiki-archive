They are mainly used in the production process of computer components. ==Production== Microchips are made at a [[Chip Plant]]. They require [[Silicon Wafers]], [[Energy Cells]] and [[Wares#Food|Food]]. ==Commentary== The [[Hub plot]] requires 75500 Microchips. It is wise to set up a production facility for them, preferably near a [[Silicon Mine]]. ==Trading information== {| ! Produced by !! Primary Resource at !! Secondary Resource at !!
