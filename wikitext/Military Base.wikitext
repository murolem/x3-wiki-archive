The Military Base is able to carry 36 [[Marines]] at a time. This makes the Base the prime spot for M7's who wish to fill up on [[Marines]] for [[Boarding]] Operations. The Military Base also carries an assortment of Goods, Weapons and Wares for the player to take advantage of.

The Military Base has almost half of the upgrades in the game and offers upgrades for player ships.

Please note that the [[Military Outpost]] is the Commonwealth's counterpart to the Terran's Military Base.
