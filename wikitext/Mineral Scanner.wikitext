This [[Wares#Ship Equipment|device]] permits a ship's scanners to determine the content of [[Asteroids]].

It will identify the type and yield of a scanned asteroid.

While not absolutely required for mining operations, it is very useful.

Scan range is usually limited to 10 km.


Used with the ''Mine Minerals'' command, if [[Special Command Software]] is installed.
