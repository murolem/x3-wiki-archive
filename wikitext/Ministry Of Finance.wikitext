The Ministry was set up to oversee the Compagny's finances when setting up new sectors, although this wing of the Teladi Compagny wasn't entirely successful. When the neighbouring system, [[Bad Debt]], was first opened to the public, the sector ran into troubleand the Ministry was held responsible. The colony skyline is dominated by the 80 story tower that casts a shadow over the gardens of trade, a large garden filled with markets and made more appealing to visiting [[Argon]] and [[Boron]] traders. ==Shipyard Availability== A small shipyard located between Paranid and Split sectors. {{Shipyard/Begin|Station|ST Size|Cost}} {{Shipyard/Station|Computer Plant||14000|1,415,340}} {{Shipyard/Station|SQUASH Mine Factory||15000|2,473,600}} {{Shipyard/Station|Energy Bolt Chaingun Forge||16500|6,396,300}} {{Shipyard/Station|Shield Prod.
