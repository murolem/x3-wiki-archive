== Overview ==

The Mistral Super Freighter has an average maximum cargo bay size and speed among [[TS+]] transports, and the worst shielding in its class, making it an unusually weak entry by [[OTAS]]. It's fairly inexpensive, though, not least thanks to the large stock cargo bay.

Compared to the [[Mistral]], the Mistral Super Freighter sacrifices speed and turrets for 2 extra 25 MJ shields. As such, it is poorly suited to combat and is reliant on its shields to allow it to escape with a jumpdrive.

== Availability ==
The Mistral Super Freighter is available from the OTAS shipyard in [[Legend's Home]]

== Suggested Roles==
Mistral Super Freighters are a lackluster choice for [[Traders|Universe Traders]].  With the weakest shields and fewest guns of any TS+ and only average cargo and speed, the MSF might not be the best choice for this role.  Its biggest claim to fame is the simplicity of supplying a freshly purchased Mistral with a [[jumpdrive]], as they are available right there at the shipyard.

With its large stock cargo bay of 10,000, it can be commissioned more cheaply for hauling bulk cargo than the other TS+, thanks to not requiring as many progressively more expensive [[Cargo Bay Extension|Cargo Bay Extensions]]. This makes the MSF an attractive choice in a CAG role.
