The lowlands, however, are filled with a thick mist for half of the planet's day. This does not seem to worry the Boron, who remain at some distance within their deep-sea homes. ===Information=== This is a particularity large sector, spanning 200 kilometers from end to end. It's also quite barren, having only a Royal Boron Trading Station and a handful of Boron food stations. It is located in an interesting location; out near the fringes of the universe map. It neighbors a small and seemingly empty Unknown Sector, as well as a fairly well defended pirate sector. There are the remnants of a shattered gate near the East Gate. ==Default [[Stations]]== ==[[Asteroids]]== == See Also == {{Boron Navbox}}
