Nevertheless, a lethal adversary in a fight, shielded and armed on the level with weaker M3s. == Equipment == {| |+ '''Missiles''' |- | *[[Poltergeist Missile]] |} == Availability == During Reunion and the Terran Conflict the Mjollnir, like all [[ATF]] ships, is not available at any shipyard to buy and as a reward on completing the [[Balance of Power]] plotline. In Albion Prelude it is available at [[Terran Shipyard]]s. == Suggested Roles== == See Also== {{M4}}
