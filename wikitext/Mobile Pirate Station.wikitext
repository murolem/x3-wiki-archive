==Overview==
Technically one of the best light carriers in the game with high speed, good shielding for a [[TL]] and a big hangar bay, this ship is actually unavailable in Vanilla, sporting a rather bugged price, costing a little over 4 million credits.

==Physical Characteristics==
As one would expect, it looks just like a Pirate Station/base.
