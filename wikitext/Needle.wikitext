==Overview==
The Needle is the Kha'ak medium missile, compatible with all Kha'ak ships but usually found on fighters.

===Encyclopedia Entry===
This is a missile that will explode near the target ship which can paralyze the target. It has a deadly power against all Fighter ships. Mostly used in Kha'ak Fighters.

==Commentary==
The Needle can down a [[M5|scout]] and deal serious damage to, if not destroy, most [[M4+|light fighters]] and [[M4|interceptors]]. Should be respected by any pilot flying one of these ships. However, the relatively slow speed of the missile means it is vulnerable to being shot down with a good eye.
