==Description==
Named after the Argon heroine and [[Goner]] priestess Nyana Gunne, great-granddaughter of the famous Argon leader Nathan Gunne, this system was the location of some of more colourful events in her life. It is now a rough place where times are hard and people harder. There is much illegal activity in this system and skirmishes are common.
