There is only one OTAS Shipyard. ===Encyclopedia Entry=== Shipyards are the heart and soul of modern societies. They are factories of gigantic dimension, built to manufacture all the space vehicles and even build and sell whole construction kits for new factories. Because of immense resources and labour required to build as well as run a factory like this, shipyards are rare to encounter. ==Products== ===Stations=== None. ===Ships=== {| style="text-align:right;" class="wikitable sortable" cellpadding="3" !
