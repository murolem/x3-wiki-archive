Operation: Loose Ends was added to [[Albion Prelude]] following its release. It continues on from the [[x3ap quests|Albion Prelude Main Plot]] and can act as a pre-requisite for [[Shady Business]].

In effect, it is the [[Terran]] equivalent to the main plot, and is largely mutually exclusive.


In it, the player will have to track down a number of items, following a series of clues to track down stolen technologies:
* The [[Xperimental Shuttle]]
* The [[Unfocused Jumpdrive]]
* Multi-functional ship equipment


'''Note:''' ''This mission will NOT appear in your missions screen, so be careful and keep track of the messages sent regarding it - they will be your only aid through the majority of the time you play this plotline.''

== Starting Conditions ==
* Started as [[Terran]] (e.g. [[Terran Commander]] or [[Aldrin Adventurer]])
* [[Combat rank]] of ''Professional'' (or higher).
* Terran [[Reputation]] of ''Local Councillor'' (or higher).

== Walkthrough ==
TBD
