An extension which permits ships to collect [[Asteroids|pebbles]] from space.

This device is crucial to [[Mobile Mining]] operations.

It must be fitted to ships with XL class cargo capacity as all ores fall in this cargo class.

Some vessels come with this device built-in.

To collect a pebble, just collide with it.

Large rocks must be broken down into pebbles and asteroids that appear on the sector map must be shattered with a large explosive or [[Mobile Drilling System]] before they can be broken down.

Attempting to collect an oversized rock will result in a collision rather than collection, causing shield damage and occasionally hull and equipment damage even if your shields hold.
