==Description==
This system is home to the NMMC corporation, formerly known as PTNI. This corporation controls the supply of the rare material Nividium and has recently reformed its policies in an attempt to downplay accusations of illegal activity. The sector name has remained unchanged for historical reasons. Its factories produce high-quality weapons for the Teladi as well as other general resources for the two planets in this sector. The system is guarded by the NMMC's security arm as well as Teladi Company ships.
