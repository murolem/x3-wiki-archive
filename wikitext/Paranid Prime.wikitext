Often, many missile and ship weapons factories can be found there as well. It's often a good one-stop shop for early players who aren't yet producing their own equipment, but, like everything in the X-Universe, this is not always the case. ===Encyclopedia Entry=== The jewel of the [[Paranid|Paranid Empire]] produces some of the finest ship equipment available - devastating thermonuclear missiles, semi-organic ship hulls, artificially intelligent flight systems and highly powerful lasers are among the tech products to be found. The skies of Paranid Prime are dominated by a fiery gas cloud, the aftermath of a terrible Xenon experiment. ==Shipyard Availability== {{Shipyard/Begin|Station|ST Size|Cost}} {{Shipyard/Station|Paranid Trading Dock||12000|29,800,064}} {{Shipyard/Station|Equipment Dock||10000|48,368,296}} {{Shipyard/Station|Crystal Fab|M|15000|3,440,968}} {{Shipyard/Station|Quantum Tube Fab||13500|4,590,120}} {{Shipyard/Station|Computer Plant||14000|1,733,468}} {{Shipyard/Station|Hornet Missile Factory||17000|2,934,560}} {{Shipyard/Station|SQUASH Mine Factory||15000|2,246,368}} {{Shipyard/Station|High Energy Plasma Thrower Forge||18000|6,713,716}} {{Shipyard/Station|Concussion Impulse Generator Forge||21000|9,380,204}} {{Shipyard/Station|Phased Shockwave Generator Forge||15000|8,917,944}} {{Shipyard/Station|Mobile Drilling System Factory||18500|3,682,484}} {{Shipyard/Station|Shield Prod.
