Yet, for a [[Teladi]] ship it is surprisingly sleek and the cockpit view is free of obstructions. == Combat == Peregrine pilots have a choice not unlike those of the [[Gannet]]: Stock up entirely on missiles for awesome longevity on the battlefield, making it vulnerable to attack, or utilizing the [[M8|bomber]] as a one off strike craft, which launches a few salvoes then retreats via jumpdrive. == Equipment == The Peregrine utilizes the [[Tomahawk Heavy Missile]]. == Availability == {| style="text-align:center;" |- style="{{Colour/Teladi}}" ! width="120px" | Variant !!
