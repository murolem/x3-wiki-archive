==Overview==
The Phased Repeater Gun or PRG is a powerful heavy fighter weapon used on [[Argon]] ships amongst others. Not to be confused with the [[Plasma Burst Generator|PBG]] or [[Phased Shockwave Generator|PSG]].

==Encyclopedia Entry==
A weapon found in some medium and large fighters.

Designed for M3 fighters to be lighter and faster than HEPTs, and also serving as a heavier weapon for M4s. The Phased Repeater Gun fires in quick bursts of 3 rounds and is ideal for taking out fast and hard-to-hit enemy fighters.
==Commentary==
The PRG is a light and fast weapon. The high shell velocity makes it a very accurate weapon and it deals a decent amount of damage, making its destructive potential against fighters very high. A good weapon for an M3 that has to deal with smaller adversaries that are too difficult to hit with the [[High Energy Plasma Thrower|HEPT]]. An excellent choice for back/front turrets on Commonwealth fighters capable of mounting and powering it; its accuracy makes it effective in a Missile Defence turret.
