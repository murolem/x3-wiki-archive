Piracy is the act of capturing, or 'capping', of NPC ships by the player. There are two types of capture - claiming and boarding.

== Claiming ==

Pilots of [[:Category:Fighters|fighters]] and other small ships will sometimes [[bail]] out when fired on; then, the ship may be [[claim|claimed]] by the player.

== Boarding ==

[[:Category:Capital Ships|Capital ships]], [[M6|corvettes]] and [[TM]]-class vessels must be [[boarding|boarded]] with [[Marines]] to be captured.

== Uses ==

There are several reasons for a player to engage in piracy:

* Some of the most powerful or unique ships in their class are not sold or rewarded to the player, and thus can only be obtained via capture. Popular targets include:
** Pirate [[Kestrel]] (M5)
** Paranid [[Hyperion Vanguard]] (M6+)
** [[I|Xenon I]] (M2+)
** ATF [[Valhalla]] (M2+) 
** Goner [[Aran]] (M1)
** Terran [[Atmospheric Lifter]] (TL)
* Capturing a ship leaves the cargo hold intact (for most item types). Some rare items, such as the [[Incendiary Bomb Launcher]] or the [[Jump Beacon]], can be easier to obtain via capturing, rather than destroying the carrying ship and hoping the cargo survives.
* Captured ships, especially larger ones, can sell for a large amount of credits.
* Some [[Missions|Plots]] involve capturing ships.
