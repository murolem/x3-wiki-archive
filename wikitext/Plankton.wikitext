It is produced naturally from certain chemical reactions that are found in the swamp mixing with the ammonia-based air. This scum is collected and then treated with additive and other Boron minerals to produce a wide range of different, and nutritious spices. Since the Boron seas are completely protected from any industrial usage, Plankton is mainly produced on huge Plankton Space Farms everywhere in the Boron Kingdom. ==Commentary== ==Trading information== {| !
