==Overview==

Plasma Burst Generator Forges are Pirate factories that produce the [[Plasma Burst Generator]] from [[Energy Cells]], [[Ore]] and [[Space Fuel]]. 

NPC stations will buy [[Crystals]] and [[Space Weed]] as secondary resources.

There are [[Plasma Burst Generator Forge]]s in the Unknown Sector east of PTNI Headquarters, in LooManckStrat's Legacy, in Danna's Chance and in Maelstrom.
However, they are hostile towards all players at the start, which means that they don't sell their [[Plasma Burst Generator|Plasma Burst Generators]] to the player. A [[Station Hack]] will solve this problem.
