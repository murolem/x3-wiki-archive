Previously their [[Headquarters]] was located in [[Ore Belt]], as of [[Albion Prelude]], it has been relocated to [[Albion Delta]]. It was founded by former philosopher and Albion's discoverer Quinlan Rorke, in 746 NT/2916 EY. After he died, a short time before the Dark started in December 31, 778 NT/2948 EY, Plutarch became a malevolent shadow of its former self. After the dark started, Plutarch took over Albion by force, defeating the Federation forces garrisoned there, and completely took over Albion. They restored slavery as a vice for the rich and wealthy, and dealt with political rivals in ways so brutal, even a Split would be sickened by them. ==Science and Technology== ===Ships=== Reward the player of these ships when reach specific ranks *Rank 4 (Mineral Specialist): [[Mercury (ship)|Mercury Prototype]] (TS) *Rank 7 (Merchant Protector): [[Advanced Discoverer]] (M5) *Rank 10 (Industrial Legend): [[Heavy Centaur Prototype]] (M6+) ===Stations=== *Headquarter located in [[Ore Belt]] ([[Albion Delta]] in Albion Prelude) ===Wares=== *[[Nividium]] ==See Also== {{Argoncategory}} [[Category:Corporations]] {{Races}}
