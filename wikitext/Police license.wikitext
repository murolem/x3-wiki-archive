Despite the name, '''police licenses''' are actually closer to [[Wikipedia:Letter of marque|letters of marque]]. Issued by the major governments of the [[Commonwealth]], they grant the player the right to legally [[Freight Scanner|scan cargo]], and issue a fixed bonus for kills scored against enemies of that government within their territory. For unknown reasons, the [[Terran]]s do not offer a similar license. A government with whom the player is licensed shows up in the "My Pilot Status" dialog with an &lt;nowiki>[L]&lt;/nowiki> after the player's [[Reputation|notoriety]] listing with said government. To obtain the license however, the play first needs to reach rank 5 in that race's [[Reputation|notoriety]] ranking. Police licenses are lost for taking hostile action against ships of that race inside their owned sectors. Lost licenses can simply be re-bought without penalty. ==Encyclopedia Entry== After buying this license pilots are accepted as police force by all space stations and factories in the &lt;issuing government> territory. They are automatically paid for every elimination of outlawed ships. ==Variants== All the Commonwealth governments offer a police license. Each offers bonuses for kills scored against the [[Kha'ak]], [[Pirates]], [[Xenon]], and [[Yaki]]. Issuing a police license costs a fee averaging 7,580 [[credits]]. ===Argon Law Enforcement License=== The '''Argon Law Enforcement License''' is issued by the [[Argon|Argon Federation]].
