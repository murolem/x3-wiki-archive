Their quiet and devoted worker-monks produced exquisite jewellery, inspiration 'Xja' poetry and the very best in automated, semi-intelligent weapons. In recent times, the focus has shifted to sophisticated technology production and interspecies trade has boomed, but the religious extremism remains, hidden in the shadows. ==Default [[Stations]]== *[[Military Outpost]] ==[[Asteroids]]== {{Asteroid/Begin}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|42|5533|5782|6856}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|35|6930|2796|-1391}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|35|-1497|4121|-13455}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|23|8717|-6661|11598}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|15|14489|-2056|928}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|14|-12794|6606|-1275}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|11|21051|-5837|-1752}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|11|-7525|-7051|-20063}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|4|-18530|2431|-1790}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|4|-16468|-3606|-5915}} {{Asteroid/Item|Silicon|42|-10805|304|-19717}} {{Asteroid/Item|Silicon|18|-18702|1779|9277}} {{Asteroid/Item|Silicon|13|-18122|-5370|8040}} {{Asteroid/Item|Silicon|11|-4479|3963|-20351}} {{Asteroid/Item|Silicon|8|-13822|-571|-11455}} {{Asteroid/End}} == See Also == {{Paranid Navbox}}
