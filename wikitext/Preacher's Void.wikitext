==Description==
The name is deceiving, but there is a meaning. The sector is located close to the Ma'kare star; the dominating feature is the flare that streams though the system. Because the stations are located so close to the star, all stations were fitted with a new reflective Teladianium armour that allow for the flares to hit the station and only affect it slightly. Although the shields do protect the stations by absorbing 80 percent of the energy, the rest is reflected back by the armour. The name come from the High Priest, who visited this sector shortly after discovery. Back then the flare was still at a distance, so the sector was a void. Many religious Paranid thought that the star that was drawing closer was an omen and so many preachers came to see this, hence the name.
