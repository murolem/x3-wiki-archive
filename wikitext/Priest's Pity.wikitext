==Description==
===Encyclopedia Entry===
This system manufactures hardware for the refit yards in [[Emperor's Ridge]]. It also provides masses of mineral and organic products to be consumed by their crews. Despite a heavy security around the military installations, the [[Space Jewellery]] workshop provides rich pickings for the more aggressive and desperate looters and pirates based in nearby systems.
