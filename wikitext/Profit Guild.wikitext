An agreement between the [[Paranid]], [[Teladi]] and [[Split]], was created to balance the increasing influence of the [[Foundation Guild]]. 

Initially consisting only of [[Paranid]] and [[Split]], the Guild increased it's influence when, after 550, the [[Teladi]] began trading with the Profit Guild. 

Eventually, in 563, the [[Teladi]] joined the Guild.
