The Matter/Anti-matter Launcher fires a bomb-like projectile which contains a small amount of anti-matter suspended in an energy field. When the energy is disrupted by impact or fails after a period of time, the anti-matter mixes with the surrounding matter, resulting in a large explosion. This weapon only fires Matter/Anti-matter Warheads. ==Commentary== An Aldrin-only variant of the [[Terran]] [[Matter/Anti-Matter Launcher]], this weapon is slightly less powerful due to a lower rate of fire. However, it is still a very dangerous corvette level weapon which is open to Aldrin heavy fighters such as the Aldrin [[Spitfyre]] and Terraformer [[deca.cefa|#deca.cefa]]. This results in fighter wings capable of easily beating down battleships in short order, though requiring considerable amounts of ammunition. Despite this, the PM/AML is very ammo-efficient compared to other ammunition based weaponry due to its low rate of fire. The only [[M6]] class ship this weapon is compatible with is the massively overpowered Aldrin [[Springblossom]]. ==Known Compatible Ships== *Aldrin [[deca.deaf|#deca.deaf]] *Aldrin [[deca.cefa|#deca.cefa]] *Aldrin [[Spitfyre]] *Aldrin [[Springblossom]] ==Available at Known Docks==
