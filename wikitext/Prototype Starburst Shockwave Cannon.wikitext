==Overview==
The Aldrin version of the [[Starburst Shockwave Cannon|Terran SSC]].

==Encyclopedia Entry==
A deadly weapon found on frigates, destroyers and carriers. 

Commonly used by United Space Command capital ships, the Starburst Shockwave Cannon is an advanced, energy-based version of the rather basic flak weapons used by other races. A projectile is fired outwards and once it reaches its maximum range, it activates and sends powerful energy waves outwards, damaging any nearby ships.

==Commentary==
This weapon is slightly less potent and with a slightly lower refire rate than its mainstream counterpart, but nevertheless is still an exceptionally deadly flak weapon.
