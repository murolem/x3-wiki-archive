==Overview==
In keeping with their pacifistic creed, the standard Goner ship, designated the '''Ranger''', is unarmed.  As such it is in its own [[:CATEGORY:Goner|category]] in the [[X-universe]].

==Background==
{{sectstub}}

==Physical Characteristics==
The Ranger closely resembles the [[Argon]] [[Nova|Nova Sentinel]], though as previously noted it has no weapons hardpoints.

== Combat ==
Flying a Ranger in combat involves exactly one "tactic":  running away.

== Equipment ==
{{sectstub}}

== Availability ==
The Ranger cannot be purchased at any shipyard.  However, it may be [[Bail|captured]].

It is also the starting ship of the [[Goner Witness]] gamestart.

== Suggested Roles==
Due to its respectable L-class cargo bay, the Ranger is sometimes used as a light freighter in much the same way as a the [[Falcon]] and [[Kea]] are used.  This appears to be its only real use.
