However, the inability to mount a [[Triplex Scanner]] means that it is not the first choice for a scout ship. ==Background== The USC's ability to patrol remote areas of the Solar System and to reconnoiter hostile territory is due in no small part to the Rapier's agility and speed. ==Physical Characteristics== The Rapier has a streamlined, rocket-shaped fuselage with three thrusters. Like all [[Terran]] ships, it is white with red trim. == Combat == The Rapier can be used as a very light fighter. However, its weapons are very expensive, and since M5s do not have a high survival rate in fights, it is best employed away from anything that will shoot at it. As a personal ship the [[EMPC]] battery and [[Poltergeist Missile]]s make it one of the strongest M5s, capable of bringing down [[M3]]s with relative ease. Unfortunately, the small weapons power generator makes it ill-suited to intense combat. == Equipment == *[[Poltergeist Missile]] == Availability == The Rapier is available at all Terran shipyards. {| style="text-align:center;" |+'''Availability''' |- style="{{Colour/Terran}}" !

Rapier || x || x || x || x |} == Suggested Roles== The Rapier is a bit of an oddball and not suited to most M5 roles. It can't mount a Triplex Scanner, limiting its utility as a sensor platform. Its weapons are too expensive for the high attrition the M5 frame suffers to make it a good screening element. It isn't the fastest M5 making it unsuitable for a courier. Perhaps its best use is to chase down and kill another M5. == See Also== {{M5}} {{M5category}} [[Category:Terran ships]] {{Terran Navbox}}
