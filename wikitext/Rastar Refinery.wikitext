==Overview==
Rastar Refineries convert [[Chelts Meat]] into [[Rastar Oil]] using [[Energy Cells]].

NPC factories also accept [[Nostrop Oil]] and [[Spaceflies]] as secondary resources:

===Encyclopedia Entry===
A Rastar Refinery is a dark and evil smelling place where large chunks of the fatty flesh of the Chelt are rendered down, and then processed to produce a fine oil called Rastar. 

Many races use this oil as lubrication for delicate mechanical parts. In addition to its other resources each factory also requires large numbers of Space flies and their food Nostrop.

==Availability==
This factory is unique to the Split.
