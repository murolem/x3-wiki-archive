==Description==
===Encyclopedia Entry===
The [[Argon]] Military have taken full advantage of the rich resources in this area. Competition is fierce with many companies all competing for business. There are still profit opportunities, however, in mining for the export market. The station here acts as a resupply point for Argon Military fighters and a good selection of surplus weapon systems can be found there.
