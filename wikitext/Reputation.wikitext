{{See also|Ranks}} Reputation is a reflection of how a [[Races|faction]] views you. Sufficiently negative reputation means that the faction in question considers you an enemy, will [[combat|attempt to kill you on sight]], and are usually marked with red reticules and sector map markers for your visual convenience. Combat and Trade Ranks can be found [[Ranks|Here]]. At a race rank of -1 you may [[docking|dock]] with a race's stations in border sectors and at a rank of 0 in core sectors. Each rank requires roughly 3 times the points to advance. For each rank you gain, you must do 3 times the work, or do things worth 3 times the notability. Each step being (more or less) geometrically harder then the last. An "L" displayed in-game after the race's rank indicated the player owns a [[Police License]] for that faction. == Introduction == &lt;br> ===Minimum Notoriety Points for Race Rank=== {{Rank
