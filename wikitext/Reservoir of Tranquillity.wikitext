Being a border colony to the local Split Family, this sector also acts as a crossroads for other Boron settlements, making it particularly important for passing trade. It is guarded by a lone destroyer with escorts, thus pirate activity here is minimal. ==Default [[Stations]]== ==[[Asteroids]]== {{Asteroid/Begin}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|28|-7459|-8258|-11322}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|26|666|1665|666}} {{Asteroid/Item|Ore|24|-4861|10016|-2464}} {{Asteroid/End}} == See Also == {{Boron Navbox}}
