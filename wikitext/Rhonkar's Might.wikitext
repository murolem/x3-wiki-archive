==Description==
Bathed in blood of war-torn nebulae, the Rhonkar Family chose this sector as a point form which to launch further onslaughts against all who opposed them, as well as lick their wounds when such battles fell short. In the outer rim, countless ware-dead are offered to the sun in remembrance of their struggle.
