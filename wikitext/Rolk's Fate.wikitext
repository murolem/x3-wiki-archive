==Description==
===Encyclopedia Entry===
This system supplies most of the weaponry used by the [[Boron]] Military in their sporadic battles against the [[Split]], in addition to the defense of their systems from [[Pirate]] and [[Xenon]] raiders. As it is the main supply and outfitting depot for the Boron space fleet, it is a prime target for Split attacks should hostilities resume between the two species.
