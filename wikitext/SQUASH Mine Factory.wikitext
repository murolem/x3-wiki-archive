==Overview==
This factory produces the SQUASH mine, a dangerous munition outlawed by several races.

===Encyclopedia Entry===
This factory produces the SQUASH mine, a small explosive device designed to blockade stations, trading routes and gates. Although these devices can be handy to use against military targets, they are considered highly illegal by some races who have witnessed some of these weapons accidentally destroy merchant and civilian ships as they do not have friend or foe recognition.
