Specifically, it features strong shields and high speed compared to other ships in the [[M4]] class. ==Background== The Sabre is a capable medium fighter that is optimized for interception duties. ==Physical Characteristics== Like all Terran fighters, the Sabre features a streamlined rocket-like fuselage, painted white with black trim. Its cockpit section resembles the beak from a bird of prey. It mounts its [[EMPC]]s in an underslung bay. == Combat == The Sabre is as potent as other M4s, but more heavily fortified. In absolute terms it is arguably the best regular M4 in a fight, but as it fits the costly and rare EMPC it is not a very cost-effective vessel. One weakness of the Sabre is its low weapon energy capacity and recharge: a Sabre with 4 EMPCs can only sustain fire for 12-13 seconds before running out of energy, and being limited to a single EMPC. == Equipment == The Sabre mounts only the [[Electro-Magnetic Plasma Cannon]] and [[Poltergeist Missile|Poltergeist missiles]]. == Availability == The Sabre is available at any Terran shipyard. {| style="text-align:center;" |+'''Availability''' |- style="{{Colour/Terran}}" !
