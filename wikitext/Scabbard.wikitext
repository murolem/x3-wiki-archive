==Overview==
The '''Scabbard''' is the [[Terran]] [[TP]]-class ship. It is the most heavily shielded TP, as well as one of the fastest, but suffers from a lack of cargo space.  It is an ideal ship for delivering [[marines]] to a target.

==Background==
The Scabbard transport is mainly used in the transfer of personnel between USC facilities and ships.

==Physical Characteristics==
The Scabbard resembles the [[TS]]-class [[Baldric]].  It features a rectangular primary hull and sloping, wedge-shaped prow.  In addition, it has an elliptical dome atop the dorsal surface, and a pair of large tailfins astern.  Like all Terran ships, it is white with red trim.

== Combat ==
The Scabbard has good survivability, even better than many [[M3|heavy fighters]], but does not pack an offensive punch and relies on other ships to cover it in a fight.

== Equipment ==
The Scabbard can mount a single [[EMPC|electro-magnetic plasma cannon]] and [[Poltergeist Missile|Poltergeist missiles]].

== Availability ==
Two Scabbards, each with a full complement of marines, are granted by the Terran authorities in the course of their [[Terran plot|mission line]].

Scabbards may also be purchased at most Terran shipyards.

== Suggested Roles==
The obvious use for a Scabbard is in completing [[Transport Passenger]] and [[Transport Passengers]] missions.  Due to its speed, it is also useful in [[boarding]] actions.
