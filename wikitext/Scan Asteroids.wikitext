A [[Missions#Other Mission|Mission]] usually offered at [[stations]] but may be offered by a spaceborne ship. ==Objective== Scan the required number of asteroids as pointed out in the mission briefing within a set time limit. ==General Difficulty:== Usually very easy; some tighter scheduled missions may class as 'normal'. ==What you will need: == * Any ship with [[Mineral Scanner]] installed - [[M5]] is best due to its speed. ==What you will find: == * Multiple asteroids in multiple Sectors, depending on time limit. ==Commentary and Strategy== Go to each required sector and scan as many asteroids as needed. You will get paid quite a high sum for doing all of them. Keep an eye out for another pilot selling asteroid info, as you may get an instant win. * Mission has been pointed out to have a possible bug after scanning the last asteroid that the mission fails. {{Missions}}
