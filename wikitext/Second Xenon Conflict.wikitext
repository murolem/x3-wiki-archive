The Second Xenon Conflict occured during the events of the original X-series game, ''[[X: Beyond the Frontier]]''. It marked the ejection of the Xenon from the north-western X-Universe and the beginnings of the expansion by all races into the New Territories. It follows on from the [[Xenon Conflict|First Xenon Conflict]] some centuries earlier. [[Category:Lore]]
