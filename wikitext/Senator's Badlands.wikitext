==Description==
Senator's Badlands is home to the [[Yaki]]'s only Shipyard. It is guarded by a large number of fighters, and is usually patrolled by an [[Akuma]].

===Encyclopedia Entry===
Mired in the torment of a war without honor, rumor suggests the Yaki have chosen this sector as a point of respite and for many of them, a place to call home. [[Argon]] and [[Paranid]] scouts returning from missions have reported ships known to be of Yaki origin, patrolling both this and the adjacent sector of Ocracoke's Storm. Clearly both sectors offer a battlefront upon which to launch attacks, while protecting the dark secrets thought to dwell deep within the Badlands. The sector's name is a clear sign of defiance to the Argon and a warning of past mistakes for the [[Teladi]].
