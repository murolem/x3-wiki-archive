==Overview==
The Yaki's M7M is the cheapest of all Missile Frigates, but that's the only advantage this ship has going for it. It is tied with the [[Argon]] [[Minotaur]] for second-slowest M7M, is poorly shielded, and has no defensive laser turrets.  Still, as with all M7Ms, if used to simply level a sector from afar, its offensive capabilities are on par with others of its class, all for a bargain price.

==Background==
With agents placed in the military forces of other races, the Yaki became aware of the advent of the missile frigate and immediately sought to counter it. The Senshi boasts an awesome array of launchers and packs a considerable punch.
==Physical Characteristics==
== Combat ==
The Senshi is extremely vulnerable to enemy attack and cannot defend itself except with missile fire, so clearing the area near a jumpgate before bringing it in to bear is recommended.
== Equipment ==
'''Missiles'''
*[[Mosquito Missile]]
*[[Hammer Heavy Torpedo]]
*[[Flail Barrage Missile]]
*[[Boarding pods]]

== Availability ==
As of Albion Prelude, the Senshi is available at the Yaki Shipyard in [[Senator's Badlands]].
== Suggested Roles==
Long-range heavy strikes.
