==Description==
A highly defended system, for reasons that only the Teladi and few other know about. Shareholders Fortuneis is a new sector developed around a small field of large asteroids. The Teladi believed that this system would provide them with a source of Nividium, a rare material found in only some parts of the universe. After they found out their research ship was incorrect in this assumption the Telai had to turn to building new factories for high-demand technologies.
