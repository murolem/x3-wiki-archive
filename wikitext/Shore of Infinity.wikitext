==Description==
Of little use to the Paranid, this system is leased by the Boron who have a budding outpost of refineries and chemical plants here. Limited trade between the [[Paranid]] and [[Boron]] takes place here and relations between the species are amicable. In return for Paranid protection the Boron lend their extensive knowledge in biochemistry to the Paranid efforts in cyber biology.
