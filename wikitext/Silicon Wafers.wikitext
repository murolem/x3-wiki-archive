==Overview==
Silicon is the main mineral resource that all modern Technology goods are based on.<bR>
A [[Silicon Mine]] may be placed on a silicon asteroid to extract silicon wafers. Alternatively, small silicon rocks may be collected in space with an [[Ore Collector]] the material collected is stored as silicon wafers and may be delivered to stations requiring it for manufacturing.

Silicon is the basis of any self-sustaining factory complex, as they are needed to produce energy cells, a commodity essential for producing food and almost anything else.
