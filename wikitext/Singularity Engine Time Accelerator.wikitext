Singularity Engine Time Accelerator, also known as SETA, is a [[Wares#Ship Equipment|device]] that shortens the perceived time pilots experience.

Players may employ SETA as a fast forward button causing the game's time to accelerate. This is useful for pilots experiencing long travel times or tycoons to increase economic processing.
