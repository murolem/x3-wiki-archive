The '''Solar System''' (also known as the '''Sol System''' or simply '''Sol'''), located in the far northeast of the [[jumpgate]] network, is the seat of power for the [[Terran]]s and the ancestral home of the [[Argon]] and [[Goner]]s.

The Solar System consists of eight planets and millions of smaller objects orbiting a class G2V main sequence star known as Sol.

== [[Sectors]] ==
The Solar System is comprised of twenty-five separate mapped sectors.  In order of distance from Sol, they are:
#[[Mercury (sector)|Mercury]]
#[[Venus]]
#[[Earth]]:  The seat of the Terran government is located here.
#[[The Moon]]
#[[Mars]]
#[[Asteroid Belt]]:  The gate to the Commonwealth is located here.
#[[Jupiter]]
#[[Jupiter 2]]
#[[Jupiter 3]]
#[[Saturn]]
#[[Saturn 2]]
#[[Saturn 3]]
#[[Titan (sector)|Titan]]
#[[Uranus]]
#[[Uranus 2]]
#[[Uranus 3]]
#[[Neptune]]
#[[Pluto]]
#[[Kuiper Belt]]
#[[Oort Cloud]]
#[[Unknown Sector (Beyond Oort Cloud 1st)]]
#[[Unknown Sector (Beyond Oort Cloud 2nd)]]
#[[Unknown Sector (Beyond Oort Cloud 3rd)]]
#[[Unknown Sector (Beyond Oort Cloud 4th)]]

Unlike in the [[Commonwealth]], transit between sectors of the Solar System is accomplished by means of [[Trans-Orbital Accelerator]]s, which cannot be jumped between.
