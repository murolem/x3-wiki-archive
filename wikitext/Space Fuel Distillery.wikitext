NPC stations buy [[Stott Spices]] as secondary resources. ===Encyclopedia Entry=== This secret factory is a distillery that produces Argon Whisky, better known to all pilots as Space Fuel. The whisky is produced from the husks of Delexian Wheat, which are mashed and mixed with Boron Spices. Due to recurring difficulties with getting supplies of Wheat through Argon Police patrols the manufacturers use Soja husk as a substitute. ==Availability== This factory is unique to the Argon. {| |- valign="top" | style="padding-right:5em;"| ===L-type=== {| style="text-align:left;" |- valign="top" | '''[[Argon#Shipyards|Argon]]''' *{{sa|Argon Prime}} *{{sa|Cloudbase Southeast}} *{{sa|Legend's Home}} *{{sa|Omicron Lyrae}} |} | ===M-type=== {| style="text-align:left;" |- valign="top" | '''[[Argon#Shipyards|Argon]]''' *{{sa|Cloudbase Southeast}} *{{sa|Legend's Home}} *{{sa|Light of Heart}} |} |} ===Useful Notes=== If built in Argon space (and possibly other race's space, untested), authorities will try to destroy it. {{Stationcategory}}
