===Encyclopedia Entry===
Although [[Spaceflies|Spacefly]] collecting is illegal, the flies have become the most costly commodity in the universe. These small creatures are lured by the high-resonance wave of the device, into the ship's hold. These spaceflies are then sold to anyone who will take them, automatically making a profit. This activity is illegal but within pirate communities it has become a way of life.
