==Overview==
The [[Terran]] equivalent of the [[Hornet Missile|Hornet]], the Spectre is a cheap and relatively fast medium/heavy munition for use against heavy fighters and corvettes. It has [[Missiles#Overview|heat seeking]] capability.

===Encyclopedia Entry===
The Spectre is a heat-seeking missile with proximity fusing, used by M3 and larger USC ships against medium-sized opponents.

==Commentary==
The Spectre is a heat-seeking missile with proximity fusing, used by [[Terran|USC]] capital ships against medium-sized opponents. 30% more powerful than the Hornet, and faster by a small margin, the drawback of this munition is the large amount of cargo space it takes up, and less range compared to its Commonwealth counterpart. The ability of Spectres to be mounted on ships smaller than corvettes, however, makes it a very dangerous munition. Exceptionally difficult to source, as the factories can never be bought.
