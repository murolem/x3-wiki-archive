==Overview==
Introduced at the same time as the [[Arrow]], the Starburst is another racer which is almost too fast for its own good.
==Background==
==Physical Characteristics==
The Starburst uses the [[Discoverer]] model.

== Combat ==
The starburst has no weapons therefore has no combat capability. While it is impossible to obtain in vanilla TC, it would have considerable usefulness as a scouting ship.

== Equipment ==
== Availability ==
You can get one as a reward for the plot [[Shady Business]].

== Suggested Roles==
The Starburst is best applied to fast-mapping, asteroid scanning and scouting roles.
