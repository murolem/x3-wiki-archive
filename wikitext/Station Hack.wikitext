Station hacks are [[Missions#Offers|offered]] at random Pirate Bases to provide a service to you, hacking a hostile station within a limited amount of sectors to become neutral. They are recognizable by the white light bulb sign over a station. No reputation loss for doing this, but it is rather expensive for beginners. 

* Offered at Teladi Stations as well, and very rarely other race stations (for example, near Duke's Haven, since there are no Teladi or Pirate bases nearby).
* You need to be within 3 sectors of the hostile station to be able to hack it.
