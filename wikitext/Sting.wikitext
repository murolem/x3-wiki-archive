==Overview==
The Sting is the [[Kha'ak]] light missile.

===Encyclopedia Entry===
This is a fast missile that will explode near the target ship. It has a deadly power against all light fighter ships. It is mostly found in [[Kha'ak Scout]]s.

==Commentary==
This munition is fast and does a reasonable about of damage, making it a serious threat to any [[M5|Scout]] and some [[M4|interceptors]] that cannot outrun it. However, like much of the Kha'ak arsenal, it no longer poses the same threat it once did in X3: Reunion: most M5s can easily dodge it or outrun it.
