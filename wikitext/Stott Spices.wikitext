==Overview==
===Encyclopedia Entry===
Stott Spices also known as Boron spices are highly regarded by all races in the known universe. They are used to mix with many different basic foodstuffs to provide tastier foods with more exotic flavouring and different flavours and tastes. They are traded in containers known as Stott Jagos. It is not known to outsiders how the chefs working inside Space Stott Mixeries archive those delicate products out of just Boron Plankton and only a few other ingredients.
