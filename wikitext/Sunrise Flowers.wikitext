Sunrise Flowers are grown on Flower Farms nowadays because of the superior light and gravity conditions in space. These flowers provide the Teladi with a number of different resources. The stem and leaves are used as vegetable matter and provide the Teladi with their basic foodstuff. The flower heads are gathered and pressed to produce a crude oil, which is used for cooking and heating purposes. ==Commentary== ==Trading information== {| ! Produced by !! Primary Resource at !!
