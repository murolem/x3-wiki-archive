TP personnel transports carry passengers in style and comfort. Personnel transports usually feature less cargo capacity and higher speed than their freight oriented brethren the {{TSclass}}. Because of their speed, they are often used as smaller freighters.&lt;br> Personnel transports come with integrated cargo bay life support systems. This is the only class of ship capable of performing the [[Transport Passenger|Luxury Transport mission]], not to be confused with standard [[Transport Passengers|Passenger Transport mission]]s. The mission text specifies when a TP is required. TP can be used for conducting [[Boarding|boarding]] operations, but cannot themselves be boarded; to [[Piracy|capture]] them, one must make the pilot [[Bail|bail]]. == Albion Prelude == In Albion Prelude, the maximum marine capacity was increased from 10 to 40, meaning that TP's are actually very useful when attempting to capture ships, although because they cannot equip [[boarding pods]], you must use them very carefully when attempting to board other ships. Especially when factoring in their low shield strength. == Sortable List == {| class="wikitable prettytable sortable" border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" style="text-align:right;" |+ '''TP Passenger Transports''' !
