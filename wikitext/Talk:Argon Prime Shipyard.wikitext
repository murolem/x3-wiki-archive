perhaps instead of listing the shipyards individually, just list them all in a one sortable table and extend it by adding the various systems the argon have shipyards in. to find a particular system's goods then just sort by system.

this will probably require splitting the ships into their own table.

I'd like to have such a sortable table on the Shipyards page, and when I figure out how to do it I'll do so, but I'd also like each Shipyard to keep its own page with the list of ships and factories it sells, in addition to links to the relevant Equipment Dock that supplies it.

Thanks Madned, this is looking good. I reckon that keeping the factories in their alphabetical order is best so that it's easy to scan through for whether a particular factory is present. [[User:Spychotic|Spychotic]] 06:11, 13 February 2011 (CST)


Do we want to sort them alphabetically, or by what they produce? Whichever it is, I'd like an answer so I can get it sorted in the code. [[User:ZacQuicksilver|ZacQuicksilver]] 01:27 2013 June 2013 (PDT)
