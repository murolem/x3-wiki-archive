the ships section is probably not a good way to do it, but interesting demonstration of a composite page technique.
Essentially you transclude the complete contents of the selected (page in this case, but may apply to section level) onto another page.

This is potentially useful when trying to use info from an existing page on multiple pages. 

As you can see though transcluding large amounts of info instead of linking it tends to balloon the linking page so use with care. it also suggests that perhaps the ship list should be broken up in sections instead of one big one. this is countered by the usefulness of multiple sort axes so that page should probably remain one big table.

== Ships Section ==

Currently it's a big long list and has very little in the way of detail, and is a bit awkward to read. It is also pretty ugly on the page. I might try and rearrange it in the next few days, but it's unlikely I'll find the time. I was quite pleased with the job I did on the navbox, so feel free to include that (or something similar) if you want.

Whatever happens, I think it should probably be reformatted slightly?
