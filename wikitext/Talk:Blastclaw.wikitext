I'm too lazy to make the changes myself but the Blastclaw should really be classed as an M3+. Its cost and overall performance put it in this bracket even if it's "officially" designated an M3. : Let's stick to what's official. You are however free to add mention of an unofficial ranking. Here let me do it for you.
