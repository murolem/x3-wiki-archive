We really need a link to a "Creating a Complex" Walkthrough... Unsigned|Chaldon really? the placement restrictions seem pretty clear to me. if you're interested however, Sanik's [[complex]] article could use a lot of work. there's a bunch of stuff about creating complexes that shouldn't be covered on the construction kit article. although a slightly more detailed breakdown of emplacing one may be a good thing.
