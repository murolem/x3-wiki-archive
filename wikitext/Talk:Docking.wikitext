==Docking Computer==
Will the AI use the docking Computer if equipped with one? I was thinking it might make fighter retrieval quicker and safer for a carrier while IS?

: not to my knowledge. i think all ai minions have to do it the hard way. i don't think there's even an option to manually order them to use it. however if you want to speed up fighter retrieval, just be out of system, that should turn off collisions which makes pathing dead simple and that half hour long exercise can be done with in seconds. docking computers are a bit of a legal cheat, since notionally they're just doing all the normal docking routine automatically, the teleport directly to dock gets them out of having to program in a more optimized docking approach, much like the green icon crash docks you. i've come into those way faster than would be reasonable to stop ordinarily.
