The recent edits to the Elite page are somewhat negative in tone, emphasizing how weak the ship is and what it cannot do. While the Elite may not indeed be a very good ship, I think its article should be more neutral in tone and focus on what can be done with the ship. For example, the ship is slow for an M4+ but is the most agile, and it has a good size cargo bay for its class. Its laser generator is average for an M4+, but it makes a particularly good Mass Driver user thanks to its cargo bay. In addition, rather than condemn the ship for its speed, perhaps describe where it can still be useful, like as a defensive complement to a carrier, or as a cheap alternative to the Nova. I'm willing to make such edits myself but I wanted to get some consensus before I go reverting somebody's new work. -[[User:Bizbag|Bizbag]] ([[User talk:Bizbag|talk]]) 20:15 12/14/12 (EST)
