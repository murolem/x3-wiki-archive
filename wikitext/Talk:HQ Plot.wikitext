== Different in AP? == I got here without completing The Hub. My personal walktrhough paraphrased is something along the lines of: *Dock at NNMC HQ *Place Teladianium M Factory in Grand Exchange *Dock at Plutarch Mining Corporation HQ *Dock at NNMC HQ *Use UFJ to harvest 75 Nvidium and return it to HQ. *Protect Ore Mine L in Scale Plate Green *Destroy Pirate Base in Wastelands *Return to NNMC HQ *Comm Talos Yohnus Nagas II **-> Albatross containing Player HQ = 46m credits. Background: Rise of Plutarch in Albion. Following up on treachery. Re: Argon investigation. NNMC competing over things. Will look into things more sometime soon. Am going to sleep now - pretty tired.
