== Different in AP? ==
I got here without completing The Hub. My personal walktrhough paraphrased is something along the lines of:

*Dock at NNMC HQ
*Place Teladianium M Factory in Grand Exchange
*Dock at Plutarch Mining Corporation HQ
*Dock at NNMC HQ
*Use UFJ to harvest 75 Nvidium and return it to HQ.
*Protect Ore Mine L in Scale Plate Green
*Destroy Pirate Base in Wastelands
*Return to NNMC HQ
*Comm Talos Yohnus Nagas II
**-> Albatross containing Player HQ = 46m credits.


Background:

Rise of Plutarch in Albion. Following up on treachery. Re: Argon investigation. NNMC competing over things.



Will look into things more sometime soon. Am going to sleep now - pretty tired. [[User:Korlus|<font color="red">'''Korlus'''</font>]] - [[User talk:Korlus|<sup>(talk)</sup>]] [[Special:contributions/Korlus|<sub>(contribs)</sub>]] 23:06, 13 August 2013 (CDT)
