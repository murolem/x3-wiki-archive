"It has limited potential for physical damage" - that seems inaccurate; this weapon does exactly the same hull DPS as a Terran M/AM launcher.

Perhaps something like "Individual shots have limited potential for physical damage, but sustained fire is roughly as effective as a Matter/Anti-Matter Launcher at destroying enemy hulls." [[Special:Contributions/124.148.190.227|124.148.190.227]] 15:02, 25 April 2011 (CDT)

Original statement may hold true if the weapon capacitor of your ship won't support sustained fire. MAML can sustain fire until ammo runs out. (course MAML can only be fitted to a handful of ships and ISR sees much greater compatibility) [[User:Madned|Madned]] 02:08, 26 April 2011 (CDT)

A valid point (they certainly flatten the battery on my Hyperion fast enough) - but that's not really the weapon that is limiting the damage. How about:
"Despite low physical damage per shot, sustained fire can cause heavy damage - however overall effectiveness may be limited by the weapon's relatively high power drain."
... And that's all the time I really want to spend on this very minor point! ;) [[Special:Contributions/124.148.190.227|124.148.190.227]] 19:07, 26 April 2011 (CDT)

: good work. and never forget all politics are local. minor points can be made larger with sufficient magnification. :D [[User:Madned|Madned]] 13:30, 27 April 2011 (CDT)
