Question: Does Mobile Mining permanently destroy the asteroid? --[[Special:Contributions/184.175.6.94|184.175.6.94]] 14:37, 21 September 2011 (CDT) IIRC, if the rock clusters of a destroyed asteroid are left alone long enough, the asteroid will respawn. It's only when a mine is placed then destroyed that the asteroid doesn't respawn.
