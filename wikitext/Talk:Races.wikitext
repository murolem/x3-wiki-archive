----
also suggest using template Rank List for ranks
it will display the ranks with a numeric ranking 10 to -5.
ie:
<pre>{{Rank List|Hero of the Federation
|Protector of the Federation
|Federation Overwatch
|Federation Marshall
|Federation Guardian
|Trusted Ally
|Accepted Advisor
|Confirmed friend
|Federation Associate
|Federation Member
|Citizen
|Suspected Foe
|Known antagonist
|Confirmed Insurgent
|Confirmed enemy
|Enemy of the Federation}}</pre>
