Just created an account and wanted to state that I am the one who made the last 2-3 edits to the Ship List page. [[User:Pairoftwos]]



Question: Is there any way to make the "Shield Type" column sort by shield power: right now, it sorts them 1GJ, 1MJ, 200MJ, 25MJ, 2GJ, 5MJ? [[User:ZacQuicksilver]]

:Not in the current state of the table. If you fill the 'Max Shield' row we're able to sort it by their strength. I'll have a look to find some kind of <em>invisible sort string</em>. ---[[User:Phanta|Phanta]] ([[User talk:Phanta|talk]]) 23:37, 24 June 2013 (CDT)

:I found something: [meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Sorting#Specifying_a_sort_key]. We can combine the three rows 'Max Shields', 'Num Shields' and 'Shield type' to one row 'Shields' in the form 'num x base_shield_size' (2 x 1GJ) and define  the <em>data-sort-value</em> attribute as the maximum shield strength in MJ. In the next one or two days I update the whole table. ---[[User:Phanta|Phanta]] ([[User talk:Phanta|talk]]) 00:01, 25 June 2013 (CDT)

Re: Super freighters being numbered 1/2; should that be "Super Freighter" and "Super Freighter XL"? [[User:ZacQuicksilver|ZacQuicksilver]]
