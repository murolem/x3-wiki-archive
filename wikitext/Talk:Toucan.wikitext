Can someone with more nouse than me check this infobox please? There's too many variants, and a TP that only carries M-class cargo is a new development to my knowledge. [[User:Spychotic|Spychotic]] 18:52, 23 October 2010 (CDT)

odd, x3tc lists the basic variant as L class, http://x3t.roguey.co.uk/ships/get_ship.php?id=138, roguey's site lists as M. not near an install currently so i can't check. [[User:Madned|Madned]] 12:38, 25 October 2010 (CDT)

Checked, current value in the encyclopedia is L [[User:Madned|Madned]] 21:43, 26 October 2010 (CDT)
