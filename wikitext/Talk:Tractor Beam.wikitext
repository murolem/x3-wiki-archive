So, apparently, just because something is "compatible" doesn't mean it will actually work. I just wasted two game sessions of about an hour each, acquiring my first tractor beam and trying to get it to work on a Mercury. I did this because several sources (in-game, Roguey, and x3wiki) all say the TB is compatible with the Mercury and other TS and TM ships. Only when I found Nanook's post did I realize the problem with energy requirement. So I have added a note about this to the TB page, and removed the Mercury, Magnetar, and Caravel. But I'm no expert; I just started playing X3 a couple of weeks ago. Have I missed anything?  [[User:Distracticus Prime|Distracticus Prime]] ([[User talk:Distracticus Prime|talk]])  28 Sep 2012
