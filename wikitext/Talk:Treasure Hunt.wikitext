I can't fix the link to Spike's walkthrough thread due to the following error:  The page you wanted to save was blocked by the spam filter. This is probably caused by a link to a blacklisted external site.

The following text is what triggered our spam filter: h-t-t-p.
Take out the dashes; it won't even let me post a copy/paste of the error!  [[User:Mileron|Mileron]] 09:37, 16 April 2011 (CDT)

Yeah, we were getting some serious spammage so the external linking was disabled. We're still getting bots that are vandalizing, but the volume is down quite a bit. Hopefully the spam filter can be switched over to a whitelist instead of a blacklist, but until a workable solution to deter spammers can be worked out the external linking is disabled. The grandfathered ones are still in, but make editing around them difficult. mostly you just have to strip off the ht-tp segments and then it'll submit again. unfortunately that means the links are bit annoying to use.
