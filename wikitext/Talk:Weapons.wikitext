Note that if you have multiple guns firing then ammunition will be used up more quickly, e.g. if you have 8 Gauss Cannons firing together they will get 25 shots each from a single unit of ammunition.

Since it's clearly out of character for the current page, I thought I would ask here before making the change myself.
