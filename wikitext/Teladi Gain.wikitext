==Description==
Once the favoured retreat of Boron philosophers and visionaries, this sector is now managed by the Teladi and has become the preferred destination of fun seekers, weedheads and space-hippies of every race. The Bliss Place in the centre of the sector produces the narcotic Space Weed, the meditative drug of choice for the dreamers, artists and neo-philosophers that are drawn here.
