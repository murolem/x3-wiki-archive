==Overview==
===Encyclopedia Entry===
Teladian mud is a very fine silty type of sediment found at the bottom of rivers and swamps on the Teladi planet. This mud when dried out becomes a hard mineral called Teladianium. This mineral can be mixed with certain chemicals, processed and can even be added to synthetic plastics to create a tough flexible material stronger than hardened steel but much lighter. In space Teladianium is produced in chemical plants called Teladianium foundries. Teladianium is used throughout the X universe by many races in the construction of buildings and the interior structures of spaceships and space stations.

==Production==

Teladianium is made at a [[Teladianium Foundry]]. It only requires [[Energy Cells]].

==Commentary==

The [[Goner plot]] requires 1200 Teladianium and the [[Hub plot]] a whopping 150,000. It is wise to set up a production facility for it, preferably near a [[Solar Power Plant]].
