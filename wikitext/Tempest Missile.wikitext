Otherwise, it is reasonably quick and powerful enough to be a serious problem to any [[:category:fighters|fighters]]. ===Encyclopedia Entry=== Dependent on the ship computer of the vessel it was launched on, the Tempest Missile scans for enemy targets and establishes priority of attack. In doing so, if the primary target is lost, it will immediately lock down the secondary, and so on, until it either runs out of fuel, or makes contact. ==Commentary== The Tempest is hailed as an extremely useful munition due primarily to its ability to re-acquire targets; it is otherwise average for its class and has the drawback of taking up a very large cargo volume. Its relatively good range mean that a number can be unloaded into a large dogfight when the launching ship is engaging, and will likely last long enough to destroy several ships before they run out of fuel. Think of the Tempest as a much more dangerous version of the [[Silkworm Missile]]. {{Missile Navbox}}
