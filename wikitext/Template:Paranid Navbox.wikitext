== Introduction ==
Racial Navboxes are ordered as follows. All items are presented in alphabetical order within their various categories - this includes ship types etc.

This template will also include any pages it is on in the appropriate racial category.

It is designed as a quick reference for information on different races, but could also be used for organizations like [[OTAS]] etc with a bit of tweaking.

Please see [[Template:Racial Navbox]] for the master template that this was copied from.

== Usage ==
When making a new Racial Navbox, please just copy the text from this page (Or subsittute it - see [{{linky}}en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Substitution Wikipedia on Substitution]) to your intended navigational page - e.g. [[Template:Argon Navbox]].

=== Sectors and Shipyards ===
Sector names should be listed in alphabetical order, and separated by a single bar ("|").
''Note:'' Two bars will break the table. Please be careful not to use two bars.

=== Ships ===
Ships should be listed in the order given. If no ship of a given type exists for a race, leave it as "None". If multiple ships of a type exist, list them in alphabetical order, each separated by a single comma.

'''Examples:'''
*"TL" comes before "TM", so TL is the first transport listed.
*'''[[TP]]:''' [[Express]], [[Phantom]]

=== Shipyards ===
Please list all racial shipyards here, super or not. Do not worry about listing the same sector twice, as removing a sector from the Core or Border sectors would leave them incomplete.

=== Racial Wares ===
List these in alphabetical order. If in doubt whether something fits into the correct racial category, check if its production is exclusive to a race, or its use is exclusive to a race. If one but not the other is true, Production trumps Consumption.

Example: [[Majaglit]] is used by Argon, Paranid, Split and Teladi stations ([[Satellite Factory]]), but is only produced by a [[Space Jewellery|Paranid Station]].  This makes it a Paranid [[wares|ware]].

== Important Notes ==
When using this page to create a new racial navbox, please take care to replace both the racial link and the category link at the bottom of the page.
