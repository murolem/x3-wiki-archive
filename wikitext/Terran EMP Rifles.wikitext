==Overview==
===Encyclopedia Entry===
Terran EMP Rifles were initially designed by the AGI Task Force for use by their secretive marine units. Now more widely used by all Terran forces, examples often find their way into unofficial hands.

==Commentary==
EMP Rifles are generally not a profitable commodity unless produced by player factories within or near Terran space, where they are in moderate demand at Terran military facilities. They can only be sold at average market price.
