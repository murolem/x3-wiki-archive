The [[Foundation Guild]] has its Headquarters and the Trading Station is the temporary seat of the newly founded Boron Chamber of Commerce. The many cattle ranches here supply [[Argnu Beef]] for the local and export markets. ===Information=== This is a very long sector, with the North and West gates about 100km away from the South and East gates. It may be shorter to fly through nearby sectors instead of flying across the sector. ==Default [[Stations]]== ==[[Asteroids]]== {{Argon Navbox}}
