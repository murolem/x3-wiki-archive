==Description==
===Encyclopedia Entry===
This system provides much needed power and food to the Argon Military as well as providing a convenient temporary HQ for the rapid response squads set up against [[Pirate]] activity and [[Xenon]] insurgence. It is often used as a base to recharge long range recon ships and carriers and as a result is well defended and often dangerous system during times of conflict.
