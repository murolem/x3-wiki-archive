It is otherwise average. ==Background== Seeing the need to provide a quick but strong medium fighter to better protect transports and to bolster raiding parties, the [[Yaki]] have developed the Tonbo. ==Physical Characteristics== == Combat == The Tonbo equips the [[PBE]], and has enough weapon energy to keep it going too. Coupled with a loadout of PACs this setup allows the Tonbo to deal horrific damage to an opponent. With a more mundane weapon setup it is still an above average light fighter due to its speed and shielding as well as its stamina. == Equipment == {| |+ '''Missiles''' |- style="vertical-align:top;" | *[[Mosquito Missile]] *[[Wasp Missile]] *[[Dragonfly Missile]] | *[[Silkworm Missile]] *[[Disruptor Missile]] *[[Firefly Missile]] | *[[Hurricane Missile]] *[[Aurora Missile]] *[[Remote Guided Warhead]] | *[[Rapier Missile]] *[[Firelance Missile]] *[[Wildfire Missile]] |} == Availability == The Tonbo is available from the [[Yaki]] shipyard in [[Senator's Badlands]]. == Suggested Roles== == See Also== *[[Raijin|Yaki Raijin]] {{M4+}} {{Yaki Navbox}}
