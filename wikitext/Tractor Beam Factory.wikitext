NPC stations will buy [[Computer Components]] as a secondary resource. ===Encyclopedia Entry=== ====Text==== This factory produces the Tractor Beam that allows you to pull objects to new locations. ====Voice Over==== The Tractor Beam is a New invention, designed primarily to move stations without the need for large and clumsy grappling systems. The beam uses a series of projected gravitic fields which in effect reduce the mass of the object making it easier to move. ==Availability== This factory is exclusive to the Paranid. {| style="text-align:left;" | '''[[Paranid#Shipyards|Paranid]]''' *{{sa|Heaven's Assertion}} *{{sa|Third Redemption}} |} {{Stationcategory}}
