The Trans-Orbital Accelerator, is the [[Terran]] equivalent of the [[jumpgate]] for use moving around the Solar System, as well as [[Aldrin]]. Rather than generating a warp tunnel between two points, it works by accelerating ships to high sublight speeds in a short distance and decelerating them at the complementary Trans-Orbital Accelerator. Trans-Orbital Accelerators are also used by the [[Argon]] in the Albion sectors.

Since warp/jump technology is not employed, the [[jumpdrive]] cannot use a Trans-Orbital Accelerator as an exit point. The jumpdrive can still be used to to jump ''out'' of a sector that has only Trans-Orbital Accelerators and no gates, but not in.

It is possible to jump into a sector connected only by Trans-Orbital Accelerators if a usable [[Jump Beacon]] is present in the sector. Only in ''Albion Prelude'' are jump beacons ever usable, so this only applies to that game.
