A [[Missions#Other Mission|Mission]] offered at [[stations]].

==Objective==
Just a simple mission to pick up and deliver goods from point A to point B within a time limit.

==General Difficulty:==
Easy, just make sure you've got enough cargo space. 

==What you will need: ==

* [[M3]]/[[TS]] ship - other ships should be ok as well 
* [[Jumpdrive]]. 
* [[Energy Cells]]. 

==What you will find: ==

* Dock at the specified station and the goods will be loaded automatically. If you do not have enough cargo space you will get a message saying so. 
* Deliver these wares as soon as possible and you will get your reward if delivered on time.

==Commentary and Strategy==
The goods you will be transporting are specialist goods and are worthless as no other station will accept them, so do not expect to become rich trying to sell them.
