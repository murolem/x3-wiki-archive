A [[Missions#Other Mission|Mission]] offered at [[stations]].

==Objective==
Same as [[Transport Passenger|taxi]] mission but with greater numbers of passengers.

==General Difficulty:==
Easy/Medium, depending on circumstance.

==What you will need: ==

* A fast ship with size M cargo or bigger, the requisite cargo capacity (6 per passenger), and [[Cargo Lifesupport System]].
* Docking Computer, to save time.

==What you will find: ==

* Anything up to 20 passengers to be transported across a couple of Sectors.

==Commentary and Strategy==
The passengers board automatically when you dock. Time is usually tight, so having and using a [[Docking Computer]] is a big, big help. A [[Jumpdrive]] will make this mission a cakewalk, but if you don't have one, you'll have to tear across space as fast as you can (something which the autopilot cannot do).

A [[TP]]-class ship is not a necessity, you simply need the requisite cargo space and the ability to get to the target in time.
