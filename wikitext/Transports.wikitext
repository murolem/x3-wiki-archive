TLs are large station transports, designed to carry and deploy stations in far away sectors.

TSes and TPs are workhorse ships, carrying wares and people from station to station.

TMs are militarized transports. They function as a small general purpose carrier, deploying small fighter groups with a minimal logistical footprint.
