==Overview==
The Tri-Beam Cannon is unavailable in the Vanilla game.

==Encyclopedia Entry==
A deadly weapon found on frigates, destroyers and carriers. Faced with the growing difficulty in increasing the lethality of beam weapons, the Paranid developed the Tri-Beam Laser Cannon, which combines three smaller beam weapons into a single larger, deadlier one.

==Commentary==
The Tri-Beam Cannon is one of the semi-implemented experimental beam weapons, and has the worst compatibility of the lot: only the Goner Truelight Seeker is compatible, and probably only because it got a mostly blanket compatibility anyway.
It has few redeeming features if scripted in, with damage, range and suchlike being quite similar to the [[Plasma Beam Cannon]], though the PBC has vanilla applications in the form of lasertowers, and better non-vanilla prospects than the TBC due to wider compatiblity.

==Known Compatible Ships==
*[[Truelight Seeker]]
==Available at Known Docks==
