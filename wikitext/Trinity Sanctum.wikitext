==Description==
This system's heavy security is due to its principal export - Jewellery and Maja Snails. The wild and untamed twin planets here are home to a nomadic workforce, famous for their expertise in raising the delicate snails. These shy, reclusive Paranid tend Snail Farms across all known space. The most valuable installations in this system are protected on two sides by artificially constructed asteroid belts.
