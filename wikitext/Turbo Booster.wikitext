==Overview== The Turbo Booster comes with the community [[bonus pack]]s of signed scripts available for download from Egosoft's website. Once the appropriate bonus pack is installed, the Turbo Booster can be found at [[Split]] equipment docks in both a Mk1 and Mk2 form, costing 1 845 524 and 17 926 236 credits respectively. ==Functionality== A key needs to be bound to activate the turbo booster. Once activated, it will dramatically boost the speed of the ship for a limited time before requiring a cooldown. The booster requires energy to function, and will consume [[Energy Cells]] if they are in the ship's cargo, otherwise it will consume shield energy. ==Difference Between Mk1 and Mk2 Booster== The Mk1 Turbo Booster is intended for anything Corvette-sized ([[M6]]) or smaller. For Frigates ([[M7]]) or larger, the Mk2 Turbo Boost is required. [[Category:Bonus Package]]
