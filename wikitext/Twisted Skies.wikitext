==Overview== Twisted Skies is one of the five possible sector names a player gets to choose from at the end of the [[A New Home]] [[missions]]. It is located north of the [[Unknown Sector (20,5)]] east of [[Zyarth's Dominion]]. ==Appearance== Upon entering the sector, the player sees a large, somewhat earth-like planet, covered in clouds to their left, and empty space (with asteroids) to their right. The sector is filled with a red nebula that encompasses most of the sector's background. Behind the gate, players will see a sort of moon-like small planet with beautiful red rings going around it horizontally. http://i54.tinypic.com/mwxlxw.jpg ==Asteroid/s== This sector contains approx. 28 asteroids for the player's own uses. Out of all of the possible player owned sectors, Twisted Skies is completely in the middle when it comes to ore, and comes second when it comes to the amount of silicon. However, the Unknown Sector south of it contains asteroids of varying yields in case this isn't enough. ==Sun/s== As with all other possible sector choices, Twisted Skies. contains 300% sun. (2 separate suns)
