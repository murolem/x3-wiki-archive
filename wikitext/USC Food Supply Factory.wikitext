NPC stations require [[Water]] as a primary resource and will buy [[Vita Kai]] and [[Flavour Pack]]s as secondary resources. ===Encyclopedia Entry=== The USC Food Supply Factory is where all of the ingredients for the [[Terran MRE]] are gathered, processed &amp; packaged into the nutritious ration packs that keep Terran forces going. ==Availability== This factory is sold exclusively at [[Terran Unknown Sector 1]]. {{Stationcategory}}
