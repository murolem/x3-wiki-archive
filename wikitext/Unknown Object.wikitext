In TC, it is not used in vanilla and lacks some facilities which would be expected of normal ships. (Cannot be sold) It also has a hull strength comparable to battleships. ==Background== ==Physical Characteristics== == Combat == == Equipment == == Availability == == Suggested Roles== == See Also== {{M3category}}
