==Overview==
The Unknown, that which lies beyond the distant gate.

Unknown sectors are the very edge of explored space. They are currently unclaimed by any faction and thus have unknown ownership.

Unknown sectors typically have No Stations or other permanent residents.

Most unknown sectors have no name and are referred to at most by grid coordinates. [[Freedom's Reach]] is an exception demonstrating a peculiar independence from even the [[Pirates]].
