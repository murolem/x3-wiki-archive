---- mostly what this wiki needs is traffic. more contributors. mostly i just format stuff. advertising on the egosoft forums would probably help a bunch.

[[User:Rexde500|Rexde500]] doesn't seem to be around that much right now? If you are a server-side admin, could you maybe take a look at the request and explanation I put on [[User_talk:Rexde500|his talk page]]? I thought it would be useful to be able to collate ship data easily.
