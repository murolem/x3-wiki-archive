Hi Knighster35,

How come you're rolling back so many pages?

I don't think I have rollback page. I add data. If you don't want them, just let me know.

I have found this X3 wiki interesting but not fully finished.
As I restarted X3 Terran Conflict, I found it could be good to help this wiki to have accurate data


==To do==
===Racial navbox===
To help users to navigate between data, I extend the racial navbox to Teladi, Split and Paranid.
*[[Template:Xenon Navbox]]

===[[Split]]===
*<s>[[Cho's Defeat]] fill default stations list</s>
*<s>[[Family Njy]] fill default stations list</s>
*<s>[[Family Pride]] fill default stations list</s>
