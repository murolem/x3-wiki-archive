Spychotic is an Engineering graduate from the University of Cambridge. He's played all of the X games excepting X-Tension, prefers the trading to the fighting and is a master of station management and economics in all the X-series games. He has written a [forum.egosoft.com/viewtopic.php?t=279332&highlight= guide] on the subject as well as two walkthroughs for the New Home and Balance of Power plotlines.

In combat, he usually delegates the job to a minion, of which he has fleets. When he does get into a scrap he can usually be found pwning arse in his trusty [[Hyperion]], but has been known to cruise around in assorted [[M3+]] ships and the occasional capital. His favourite personal ships are the [[Nova]] early on, then the [[Skiron]] and finally his trusty [[Hyperion]]. However, his favourite fleet ships are the [[Osaka]], [[Chimera]] and [[Thresher]], and enemies of his Corporation usually find themselves going up against large groups of all three.
