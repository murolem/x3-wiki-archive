"Vanilla" is the term used to describe a game that has not been [[Scripts & Mods|modded]] to produce a *modified* tag in the player's Pilot Info box. Most guides and strategy tips are for Vanilla games, although specific strategies for some mods are made by mod users.

It is of note that there are many ships and weapons included in Vanilla game files that the game does not use; despite the code for the entities being present, they can only be unlocked and spawned in-game by using scripts.

Scripts are console commands using existing commands to enable features closed by default.

Modding generally refers to external programming changes which creates new features or modifies existing behavior.

The terms are sometimes used interchangeably as they both create non-vanilla experiences, however, a clear distinction between the two should be drawn.
