{{See also|Missiles}} Weapons are primarily designed to inflict damage on other ships. They play an obvious role in altering [[Combat#Combat_strategies|one's combat strategies]], as they largely determine your ship's strengths and weaknesses in [[combat]]. They may however be used to break up space debris, intercept missiles, and repair ships (with repair lasers). Some weapons are very energy efficient, usually a result of requiring ammunition. Direct fire weapons like those listed below can be characterized as either a beam, area of effect, or a bolt. == Weapon Types == ===Bolt weapons=== *Fire discrete projectiles which travel through space at the listed speed. *May fire repeatedly at the specified rate of fire. *Accuracy depends on the bullet speed, which ranges from slow capital ship cannons to Flak that exceeds the speed of beam weapons. *Most weapons fit into this category. ===Beam weapons=== *Are virtually impossible to evade because all beam weapons have a very high propagation speed. *Generate a beam until the trigger is released or energy is depleted. *Few Beam Weapons commonly seen in-game: The [[Alpha Kyon Emitter|Alpha]], [[Beta Kyon Emitter|Beta]] and [[Gamma Kyon Emitter|Gamma]] Kyon Emitters, the [[Pulsed Beam Emitter]] and the [[Ion Disruptor]]. ===Shockwave weapons=== *Are almost impossible to evade since some can cover an area that is over 1 km wide. *Fire a cone of destruction hitting victims multiple times, inflicting a huge multiplier on large targets. *Often a source of friendly fire. *Few Shockwave weapons available: Only the [[Phased Shockwave Generator]] and the [[Plasma Burst Generator]] are available. ===Flak weapons=== *Are primarily designed as anti-fighter weapons. *Create a large damage area capable of seriously damaging fighters. *Very few Flak Weapons are available: The [[Fragmentation Bomb Launcher]], [[Flak Artillery Array]], [[Starburst Shockwave Cannon]] and [[Cluster Flak Array]] === Ammunition Based Weapons === *Far more energy efficient than their equivalents, they require constant supplies of ammunition to fire. *Each ammunition crate holds 200 rounds of ammunition. This means certain weapons use ammunition faster than others. *Storing and re-equipping becomes a matter of logistics. [[OOS]] combat uses ammunition very quickly. *Few Ammunition Based Weapons Available: The [[Mass Driver]], [[Energy Bolt Chaingun]], [[Matter/Anti-Matter Launcher]] (and [[Prototype Matter/Anti-Matter Launcher|P-M/AML]]) and the [[Gauss Cannon]] are the only weapons requiring Ammunition. *Available Ammunition Types: [[Mass Driver Ammunition]], [[Energy Bolt Chaingun Ammunition]], [[Gauss Cannon Ammunition]] and [[ Matter/Anti-Matter Warhead]]s ==Damage== Damage is inflicted in two ways. ====Hull==== Hulls are the outer shells of ships, they usually protect the equipment that makes a ship a ship rather than a blasted out derelict. Damage to the hull directly damages the ship and its equipment. ====Shield==== [[Shields]] are a protective energy field which primarily keeps micrometeorites and other debris from harming the hull in the course of normal navigation. They also protect the hull from weapons fire. Typically the shields must first be overcome to damage a ship. ==Weapons List== A graphical table can be found at public.tableausoftware.com/views/X3Weapons/X3WeaponReport {| class="prettytable wikitable sortable" border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" !Name !!Shield Damage(Per second) !!Shield (per&amp;nbsp;MJ)!!Hull Damage(Per second) !!Hull (per&amp;nbsp;MJ)!!
