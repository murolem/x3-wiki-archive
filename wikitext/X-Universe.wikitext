The X-Universe is the term used for all known [[sectors]] and [[races]] connected by the ancient gate network.

For example, the [[Terran]]s of [[Earth]] and [[Aldrin]] are not really part of the X-Universe, as they were disconnected and reconnected. 

Traditionally, the X-Universe was comprised of the [[Commonwealth]], [[Pirate]], [[Yaki]] and [[Xenon]] sectors.

[[Kha'ak]] are believed to have come from another network of gates and have broken out using their Gateless jumpdrives.
