The coordinates for this gate were lost, but a recent survey by Argon Expeditionary forces have since rediscovered the gate's location. In Terran Conflict, there is an [[Ownerless ships|unowned]] [[Scorpion|Scorpion Raider]] in this sector. ==Default [[Stations]]== *[[Xenon Shipyard]] ==[[Asteroids]]==
