==Description==
After the battle in the sector known today as [[Nopileos' Memorial]], the [[Xenon]] have used this sector as a junkyard, storing and recycling ships here. The coordinates for this gate were lost, but a recent survey by Argon Expeditionary forces have since rediscovered the gate's location.

In Terran Conflict, there is an [[Ownerless ships|unowned]] [[Scorpion|Scorpion Raider]] in this sector.
