==Description==
Discovered while exploring [[Getsu Fune]], this sector was cleared of Xenon by a small force of ships. Unfortunately, soon after this mission was completed the Argon Destroyer was ambushed. Its Captain's last report stated that the Xenon entered the sector from [[Unknown Sector (16,0)|an unexplored gate]], the position of which was not recorded. The Destroyer was never heard from again. The sector has rarely been entered since and is considered by the Argon to be somewhat cursed in its nature.
==Default [[Stations]]==
The Xenon have no stations in this sector.
