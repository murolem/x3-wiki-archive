=General=
The ruthless Yaki pirates have taken advantage of the weakened Argon fleet to carry out raids on Argon facilities and many other sectors in the X-Universe. The Yaki pirates are becoming a real force to be reckoned with. Their activities have all the hallmarks of deliberate creation of chaos and confusion in order to undermine law and order throughout the universe. They are known for their frequent attacks on isolated traders because they are easy targets, often without fighter escorts.
==Government and politics==

===Foreign relations and military===
The Yaki are not aligned with anyone due to their stigmatizing status with other races, although they maintain stable relations with the [[Teladi]], thanks to their neutral attitude. They are hostile to even regular [[Pirates]], possibly due to competitive attitudes with each other.
