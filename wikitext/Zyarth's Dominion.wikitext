==Description==
===Encyclopedia Entry===
After establishing their primary system to the anger of the Ryk family, the Zyarth patriarch gained the friendship of the Njy family and secured resources to establish their second system. Zyarth's Dominion was formed bordering a [[Xenon Sector 598|dangerous Xenon system]].

===Information===
Zyarth's Dominion is the last system of the galactic northeast before hitting the Xenon core sectors.

In Albion Prelude, the West Gate is shut off, completely isolating the family Zyarth from the rest of the universe, with three Split sectors completely vanishing from contact. The West gate still exists, but is mysteriously silent.

==Shipyard Availability==
This [[Split Shipyard|Split Super Shipyard]] exists at a crossroads between Boron, Xenon and New Sectors.
